hello students welcome back it's time to learn how the pieces move but before we get to it let's review what we learned in Lesson number one and anyways we have to do it anytime you're going to play chess so first thing we have to make sure the board is set up the right way and all we have to do is basically make sure that this square the bottom right corner is a light square if that's not the case just rotate the board and you're going to be just fine then I'm going to set up my pieces I'm going to start with the white pieces I'm going to bring my rook then the knight and the bishop and then I go to the other side rook Knight Bishop then it's time to put the Queen and the king in the middle and since I'm setting up the white pieces my queen is going to be light so I put it on the light square that's the rule and then the King goes next to the Queen and of course we just put the pawns in front now I'm going to set up the black pieces you could do it just like I did with the white pieces or you could do it by pieces like put the rooks first one on each corner then next to the rooks we put the knights then the bishops and this time the queen is dark so that means the Queen goes on the dark square the King goes next to her and pawns go in front and honestly once you get the hang of it you could put it anywhere you want you could put a bishop first and upon it doesn't really matter as long as you put the pieces where they belong and if at this point you're still having trouble setting up the pieces trust me all it takes to fix that little problem is do it over and over and over and over if you do it five times seven times ten times and if you do it as quickly as you can try to have fun with it do it as quickly as you can trust me that's what it takes to fix it and one of the main mistakes you're gonna see people doing at the beginning is that they confuse the knight and the bishop they put the bishop with the nighties and so on or the Queen and the king but again with a little bit of practice that's going to be out of the way now with this being said let's move on to how the pieces move and for that I'm going to of all of the pieces and just leave the kingdom so here we go we're gonna start with the King because the King is one of the easiest pieces to learn and basically the King is going to move one step in every direction if you look at the the White King the king could move to any of these squares right next line so it's like you could think of it like a like a box of eight squares that the King is always going to have access to if you pay attention to the black king notice that I put him at the edge on purpose because in this case the King has only five squares that he could go to we don't have more space on the board so he has only access to five squares if I happen to have the King at one of the of the corners then it's not going to be eight or five squares it's going to be only three squares so he could move too and that's it that's how the King moves I'm going to give you a small exercise that way you can sort of see it a little bit better but this is all it takes so let me just move the Kings a little bit let me bring some more pieces around right so take a look at this exercise I just want you to see how the king is going to move and also I wanted to go over a few other rules with this with this example so in this exercise basically our goal is going to get this King to this square and the black King is going to make his way to this square and I would like to highlight another rule and this rule is that the Kings cannot jump over pieces and they cannot go to squares where their own pieces are placed like in this case I want to go all the way to this square but I cannot go this way they'll be the fastest way just going probably app one step at a time and then turn but this point is in the way so I can then move that way so I told you the King has access to eight squares but that's only when they are empty there's no none of these pieces on those words so here I have to go to this square and then make my way up one step at a time that's the only way for the King for the black king same thing he can that move you're here right now but he could move up then here and so on so with that being said let's get to it in chess you're gonna take turns so the white pieces take a turn and the black pieces and so on so I move my king that's going up but notice is one step at a time and then I'm gonna take a pause at this at this moment just to go over one more time so this King could move to any of these squares and the black King could move to any of these squares of course it doesn't make sense to go back to a size right now we have an objective so let's keep going to our destination so the King goes here and just like that the black King got to a square and my King needs two more moves so he moved there let's say we make a move with the King again just to allow the white cane to get to its destination and that's it as you can see was one move at a time now that being said I hope you understood how the King moves let me now do the same thing and just bring the Queen on the board now the queen is going to be similar to the king in the sense that the Queen could move one step in every direction but the queen is actually way better the Queen happens to be the most powerful piece in chess and Queen can actually go in every direction but as many squares as she likes so that's what makes her the best piece so all of these squares are the ones and the Queen can move to and I'm going to do it also by highlighting it maybe it's it paints a better picture this way then I go diagonally so it's going to be always on a straight line but see how many squares a queen can move to and that's it so you could move in any direction on a straight line and of course the Queen just like the Kings cannot jump over other pieces it cannot turn so you see she can go so far but it has to be in a straight line if I wanted this Queen to go from here to here it'll require two terms I can not just in one move go like that we'll just place it over there I have to make a move probably I go over here then my opponent makes a move and then I could go like that but as long as you go straight you could go as far as you like so just to give you just to practice a little bit more let's say I put my Queen over here so my question to you is do you think this Queen could go from here all the way here oh yes the Queen could just go diagonally straight and I could move there so if it was my turn I put my Queen there and I'm done now let me put the Queen over here can the queen go from here to here not in one move there's no way you can go on a straight line to that square what about over here all the way to the other side oh yes they quickly go on this diagonal and you could make it all the way to the other side and that's it that's how the Queen moves as many squares as you like in any direction so let me bring it to the center and now it's time to go over to the next piece here we are with the rook the rook is going to move through the files and the ranks if you remember from lesson number one files or the lines that go up and down and the ranks are the lines that go side to side so that's exactly how the rook moves as many steps as you like up down side to side that's it you could move one step you could move two steps or you could go all the way to the end of the board as long as you go in a straight line up down side to side so just like I did with the Queen I'm going to highlight this course that this rook specifically could go to from its current position if I want I could go up to the square I could go out to this one I'll go all the way up to the end same thing side to side or going down now let me change position for the work I'm going to put it right here not from here is the same thing I could go up down of course I don't have downed it there's no more space to go down with the rook I could go to the right and I cannot go to the left in this case for the same reason there's no more space but as long as I have space on the board I could move up down side to side so from this position up there at the corner we could move to any of these squares or to any of these squares if just to give you another example if the rook happens to be over here well I could move up only one square at out more space I could move down I could move to the left and to the right I can only go up to one square because that's what I have now let me ask you a few questions about the rook can the rook from this position move all the way here well yes I could just go all the way to the right and it's a good move now let's say I'm here can we go from here all the way to this square or in one move I cannot go like that that route doesn't move diagonally so again the rook is going to move straight up down side to side alright so now let me bring the bishop the bishop is also going to move in a straight line but the bishop actually is the piece that moves through the diagonals the rook we said moved through files on ranks well the bishop is a 1 the moves through the diadem's and that's it that's all you have to know just like the rook just like the Queen just like the king the bishop can that jump over other pieces you can now move to squares where his old pieces are set up but as long as he is clear he could move diagonally one step two steps all the way to the end of the board let me highlight this course you could move to and it is important to mention that bishops they never switch color meaning that if this Bishop starts on a dark square he can never switch to a light square so he's gonna be on the door squares for the whole game and the same thing if I bring another bishop and I put it on this light square you will never see the specific bishop switched into a dark square he can that happen and that's what he goes to Atlanta he goes this one goes through the light squares the other Bishop is going to go through the dark squares now just for you to see the contrast between the rook and the bishop let me bring the two pieces on the board so I'm going to put the bishop here this Bishop is going to move diagonally while the rook is going to move side-to-side up and out so I hope this becomes clear I'm sorry that I keep repeating the same thing over and over but I really want you to get a clear before we move on to the next piece and now we only have two more pieces to learn the knight and the pond so let's get it done so here we have the knight I'm going to put in the middle of the board there are two ways to learn how to move tonight I'm going to teach you the way that I learned and I'm going to teach you the way that I teach my younger students so the way that I learned I was that the name three steps in l-shape so think of the capital L and then that is going to move like that three steps so what does that mean well this night could move one two and three so if you think about it this is the L shape there's gonna be three steps in total in L shape one two three but of course and I could move up down side to side as strong as you do this the l-shaped and that is the only piece that doesn't move in a straight line so let me show you all of the different squares and I could move to using this technique so I could move down into the right down into the left so these two squares and I could jump to I could also go to the side and then down to the side and up I could move to the left and down I could move to the left and up and of course I could move up to the right and out to the left so these are the squares that the knight can jump to when a mat is in the middle of the board he could move to eight different squares now if we put the night let's say he goes to the edge he doesn't have eight squares to move to anymore he only has one two three and four so that's how denied moved and if I bring it let's say I'm gonna bring it back to the center here's one more thing that I want you to notice and it's the fact that the night he always switched his colors meaning that he jumped from a dark square to a night square so any square that he jumps to from here is going to be a light square now if I move it let's say here one two and three now once he moves again from here since he's sitting on a light square he's going to move to a dark square so that's another way for you to make sure you're moving it in the right and the right way so let me put it back here and show you the other way that you can learn the night if it's getting too complicated like this way or you want to break it down for someone else you could say that the night moves one step like the and one-step like the bishop or one step' like the bishop and one step left at work so if you if you start going in this direction going up you can move one step like that work one step like the bishop and it's the same thing as going three steps in ljp if you do it down you could go one step like that rook one step like the bishop and it's the same thing as going three steps in our shape same thing to a site once I bet the Brooke wants them back the bishop so that's how did I move there is something else very cool about the night and it is a fact that the night is the only piece in chess that is allowed to jump over all the pieces I've been telling you all this time about the rogue the bishop the king and the Queen how they can not jump over other pieces well the knight can so let me put all of the pieces from the very beginning so they just set up ready to start the game you're going to see how if I wanted to move this rook the rook cannot move right now same thing for the bishop he could go diagonally but there is a pond going this way there's a pond going this way so he stuck the King moves one step in every direction but in every direction that he wants to move right now there is a PT is blocking him the queen is so powerful but at the very beginning it can move anywhere since her pieces so long but the Knights the Knights could just jump over pieces so if we go in L shape three steps I could go one two three or one two three so I could jump to any of these two squares if I want to move it like the rook and then like the bishop could go one side like that work once that make the vision now just to give you an example let me show you this random position and we're going to be used in the night so I'm going to start by moving this Knight and he could go one two three he could jump over the pond and be developed and let's say the black pieces move this night it would go one two three and then I move this over night I'm going to put it this time I'm going to go to the side I'm going to go want like a brook one like the bishop then let's say this Knight goes one two three now if I wanted to move this night I could jump over this pond one two three and it's okay or I could go to the side I could go one two jump over my own pond and I could go here so that's it just make sure that the square where the night is going to land it's available so I hope this explains how the night moves and again don't worry too much about it if it's still confusing we're going to be doing so many exercises that you're going to get it in no time and last but not least we have the ponds and ponds are also pretty pretty easy to learn because ponds move only straighforward these are the only pieces that can never go backward and ponds are actually going to move one or two steps at a time no more than that now the trick is to know when the pond can move one step and when he could move both so let's get to it ponds are going to move like I said one step forward that's what they could do except for when they are at the very beginning if one of your pawns have never moved then that pond has a right to move two steps but once a pawn moves then that ponds can only continue one step at a time the way I explain it to my younger students I tell him that ponds at the very beginning and full of energy so they could do one step or one and two but once they move let's say I move this point here then the pond loses energy and he continues one step at a time so let me bring it back and let's take a look at some examples so if I wanted to move this point the question is has this point moves before No so he said the beginning Square and that means he could move one step or he could move two steps I'm going to choose to move them two steps this time and then it's the black pieces to move and they're going to move this point they're going to move it one then I'm going to choose this point I'm going to move it two steps let's say they move this pawn two steps now if I wanted to move any of these two pawns I can only move it one step there's no two steps anymore now any of the other points they could of course do one or two because they haven't moved so I'm going to choose this pawn I'm going to move it once and then same thing for the black pieces if they want to move this pawn it has to be one step only he already moved he lost energy these are the pawn has it moved yes so only one step at a time any of the other plans were at the very beginning they have to write to still do one or two steps that's it so that's how the pawn moves just remember straight forward pawns can then move to the side Ponte can I just start marching diagonal they move forward one or two steps ok everyone if you've made it this far we can say you have almost all of the foundation most of the pieces capture the same way they move so it's going to be very easy next class should take us only a few minutes this one took us a little bit longer because I wanted to make sure you understood everything about how to move the pieces it didn't make sense to just go over a few pieces in this lesson and break it down this way we got all of the pieces out of the way and again next class a few minutes you're going to learn how the pieces move then you're going to learn check and checkmate it's just a concept you have to understand and at that point you will be able to play your first game so don't give up and I'll see you in the next lesson
