hello students welcome back and I hope you're ready to play our first chess game but today we're going to use everything we've learned so far we're going to play against a computer so if you don't have anyone to play with just go online and look fresh chess website or a chess engine there are many out there just pick any and we're going to play first against level number one like typically they're gonna have different levels of course number one is the easiest and number one is going to be a robot that just knows the basics and guess what that's what we know so far just knows how the pieces move or they capture it understands check and checkmate but still it doesn't know a lot about many of the more advanced rules and it doesn't a lot of tactics so it's going to be a good starting point for for you we're going to be focusing mainly on developing our pieces trying to capture our opponent's pieces and get to the skin and put them in in checkmate and that's all you should be doing right now these three were so you see to the right these are concepts that we haven't discussed yet but we have to we have ampersand we have castling and we have promotion so I'm going to try not to do any of these two things in this game because we haven't discussed them yet but the next lesson that's exactly what we're going to go over so with that being said let's get you to play your first game I'm going to see here I have the difficulty levels for this software I'm going to choose number one don't want the computer to to play as the black cross device I'm gonna have them play as the white pieces and now you're going to see they already did the first move so they put a knife from here they burn over to 2d square something that I haven't mentioned before but it's very important to you know it is that when you play chess always the white pieces go first so you're going to see many beginners like trying to be the white pieces all the time because they want to go first honestly as you learn more you're going to see it doesn't make a difference if you know what you're doing it doesn't really matter if you're white or bags but yes that's a rule white pieces always start the game so he went not at three I'm going to start by moving my pawn to steps now he removed the point and as a general rule this is something that we are going to discuss later on but generally you want to be controlling the center of the battlefield and develop your knights and bishops as quickly as you can so now I'm going to develop this mission so this Bishop could move here here here here or here if I go the way to the end well his pawns could take me that's not a good idea so I'm going to move it up to here to attack he's night so here very moved I think I'm gonna take it that's how the bishop moves and now instead of taking me notice how the bishop went over here and the bishop is attacking my King so that's check now as much as I want to take his Queen which is the most powerful piece look what happens if I try to do that it's telling me that my king is in check so now I have to do CPR C is captured the bishop can I capture well not right now can I protect yes I could put my knight in that way I could put my pawn in the way so I'm going to use my pawn all right now my pawn was not only blocking but I can also capture the bishop and I think that's what I'm going to do he took me back and now the queen is the one putting me in check so I need to get out of check and this time I'm going to block with my knight going to put it right here you move the King now let me try to get this quaint I'm going to move my pawn up and it didn't move the Queen then I could go ahead and capture the Queen so let me leave it right here he moved it away okay now let me use this pawn ha so he took my knight and now my pawn he's putting me in check but this time I could do when I do CPR I could use C which is captured my pawn could just capture the Queen and there's no check anymore notice that he has put me in check like three times and I have never moved the King the last resource is R which is running away first I need to see if I could capture or if I could protect so my turn I'm going to bring my Queen into the attack I'm going to get closer to his King no I'm gonna go up so let me stop bringing my queen out coins her is not good to get the Queen's out so early because you could lose the Queen like he did but now it's pretty say so making sure that no one can get me and now let me see maybe I could bring my pawn up to help me now okay I'm going to bring my rook my booot goes up now he's moving little pawns I'm using the rooks the Queen which are a little bit more aggressive so let me see this Bishop tend to bring the bishop I'm going to look I wish I could just take this but then his pawn is going to take me so I think instead I'm going to put the bishop right here so he did the same thing he move the bishop now let me put him in check look if I put the rule here I'll be attacking the King so that's gonna be a nice check he has to move the King now what if I could continue to attack well let me bring this work now over here and this is something that you're going to try to do in your games try to use all of your pieces they need to work together as a team now let me just go and get this pawn okay he could have taken me he didn't well then I'm going to take the knight if you didn't take me there so this is you see how bad this Robert is it should be trying to take me back and now I think I'm gonna get the bishop to actually you know what I'm not gonna take it with the bishop I'm going to use my rook so have another piece getting close to the king now I'm going to bring my queen my queen could capture this point it could capture this pawn or capture the rook well the rook is better than the pawn so I'm just gonna go there and catch the rook and now I have checkmate in one move oh how do I do it well I have to look at the different checks that I have how can i attack the king I could use my rook to go here and attack the king I could use my rook to go here and attack the King and I could also use my queen so I think I'm going to put my Queen down here look it says game over you want now why did I win the game well my queen is attacking the king that's check and now we're gonna do CPR see can anyone capture the Queen oh the King is too far he cannot get to microwave he is protect no one can get in the way and then our is run away let's see can the King run over here well my rook is not letting him escape through there so he cannot put himself into check then going here like Queen and my book and going to this square is the same thing as my rook and microwave so the king is in check and he cannot scape it the game is over I won my first chess game so I hope this shows you more or less where you're going to be getting in your first game if you haven't played it yet and it's going to be like this for a while it's gonna be just about capturing pieces and eventually get into the King next class is going to get a little bit more sophisticated as we're going to learn about castling which is very useful to put the King in safety promotion and of course emphasize so I'll leave you with this guy's feel free to play as much as you can hopefully by the next time we meet you're going to have played enough so that you have more practice and a better vision of the board so I'll see you guys next time
