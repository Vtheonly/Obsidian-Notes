okay everyone um finally we're going to learn how to win a chess game we're going to talk about check and checkmate and once you understand this concept we can actually play our first chess game from beginning to end so what is check let's start with check um and let me give you this quick example so here um we have this position is the white pieces to move and let's say i move this rook to this square now from here we know that the rook moves up down side to side so we can tell that the rook is attacking the knight meaning that the rook is ready to capture that knight so it's up to the black pieces if they want to move the knight to safety like i could go one two three here and i'm safe or maybe i just don't mind if you take my knight and maybe the black pieces just move the king let's say they go here and that's it it's up to them that's their choice of course for the most part you don't want to lose your pieces so maybe this is not the best move but it is possible now what if instead of going after the knight i put my rook over here and in this case the rook is not attacking the knight the rook is attacking the king well this is when check comes into play in chess you can never capture the king so we already learned in the last class how to capture pieces but the kings can never be captured if you ever see someone playing chess and one of the kings is not on the board they're doing something wrong so czech basically means one of the kings is in danger one of the kings is being attacked before when i attacked the knight it was no big deal but if you attack the king it's customary to just say check so you could say it out loud hey your king's in check especially at the beginning that way you don't you make these mistakes so once the king is in check the black pieces need to get out of check it's not like they could do something else they cannot just move the knight let's say one two three because you see it's letting me know that i'm in check so if this happened in a real game you as the white pieces need to tell them you cannot do that move you in check so there are three things that they could do to get out of check we call this cpr now c stand for capture can anyone capture the attacking piece if they could well that's one way to get get me out of the game so let's say i had a bishop let me see if it lets me put a bishop here so let's say this bishop was here well i'm in check but if it's black to move they could just get my rook and that's it the black king is not in check anymore so the other thing that they could do is they could block so let's say that this bishop instead is over here i'm still putting the king in check but it's black to move they could get in the way so that's p protect so cpr c is captured p means protect putting someone in the way you see but in this case my king is not in check anymore because we know rooks cannot jump over pieces and then the last one is r which is run away so if you cannot capture if you cannot protect the king then the king is to run out of the check so he has to move here here here here here or here like if i go to the side that's it the rook is not putting me in check anymore now it's important to highlight that kings cannot get themselves into check so now that you're in check if you move down here if you try to go there you won't be allowed to because you'll be putting yourself into check okay so now check means one of the kings being attacked and the moment this happens you have to immediately get out of check and let me go back to that other point where i mentioned the king cannot get himself into check let's say from the original position i'm not putting you in check let's say i just move my rook right here so the question to you is is this rook putting the king in check no the answer is no because the rook only attacks like this so i'm not attacking the king but now this king is not allowed to go to any of these three squares because the king is putting himself in check that's not allowed so if i'm playing someone now if i'm playing online look the computer doesn't even let you put the king there but if i just put the king there then the white pieces are supposed to let the black pieces know this is an illegal move this is not allowed in chess you cannot put yourself in to check so you have to tell the hey put it back and do another move something else that is safe like you could just go here that's a normal move or you can move the knight so i hope you understand what check means so simple and plain check means one of the kings is being attacked if you attack any other piece like even if i put the queen on the board let's say the queen is here if i go and attack that queen i'm attacking it but it's not czech so they don't have to move the queen they could they should the queen is important but they don't have to if i attack the knight let me put it back if i go after the knight well that's not check now if i attack the king then that is check all right so now let's talk about checkmate now look at this position checkmate is basically when the king is in check but the king cannot get out of check then that would be checkmate that's how you win a chess game so let me give you this example here my rook this rook could put the king in check in two different ways i could go up up to here or i could go up to here and both ways i'm attacking the black king so let me start with this one i'm going to bring my rook up now the king is being attacked so i have to say check now the black pieces know they need to get out of check first cpr first is capture can the king capture the rook well he can't because if he tries to capture the rook look it's not letting me it's telling me that something is wrong well we learned that the king cannot put himself into check so if i go ahead and get the rook look he would be in check by the other rook so that's an illegal move he cannot take the rook because he'll be still in check so let me put the rook back and let's take a look at what the king could really do so see capture is not an option p which is protect is not an option either there's another black piece that could get in between the king and the rook to blockade the attack of the rook so c doesn't work p doesn't work then we have r r means run away let's see the king could move to any of the squares next to him so if he goes here well he can't he'll be in check by the rook so that's not an option if i try to go there no up here well i'm still being attacked by the two rooks so that's not an option however if i go here i'm safe no one is attacking me there if i go here i'm safe so was this move checkmate well no it's check because the king is in check he's being attacked but it's not checkmate because it could go to safety so let me bring it back and let's take a look at the other option if instead i put the rook here this is also check but in this case it's checkmate cpr c is captured can anyone capture the rook no the king only goes one step at a time p is protect no one could get in the way of the of the rook's attack so that's not an option and an r is run away the king could go to any of these squares but any of the squares that he goes to he's going to be attacked by either this rook or the other rook so if i move here it's not it's not allowed here the same thing here the same thing and this is checkmate at this point if you're playing in a physical chess board you just put the king down and that means the game is over so this is checkmate now of course i'm going to give you uh two more examples just for you to actually understand what this is and i want to give you two of the most popular checkmates among beginners so the first one is the two move checkmate the livernod is a way to do checkmate in two moves does it happen often no because they have to do specific moves um so that's why you almost never see it so checkmate into moves goes like this the white pieces have to do a move like this then the black pieces go pawn over here and then if the white pieces move this pawn two steps now notice how this queen could travel diagonally all the way here and then from that square the queen is attacking the king so at this moment you should say check and then we're going to find out if it's only check or checkmate so let's do cpr c means capture can anyone capture this queen no this pawn captures diagonally so he cannot get to the queen this one the same thing he doesn't capture forward he only captures that accurately so capture is not it's not an option the knight he only goes one two three he cannot reach the queen um p is protect can any of these pieces get in the way of the queen's attack well no the bishop only goes diagonally the knight goes here or here and the pawn he only goes attack only to capture so he cannot just move there and block so c doesn't work p doesn't work and then r is run away the king cannot go to any of these squares because they are occupied by another piece and this is the only one but if he goes here he's still going to be in check by the queen and he cannot put himself into check so this is not an option and just like that checkmate into moves again notice how no pieces were captured and it only took two moves the game is over does it happen often at all chess games like this no but just for you to understand what checkmate is now let me show you another one that is more uh easy to see some people call it the four move checkmate some people call it this colors mate and it goes like this so the white pieces go pawn to here two steps the black pieces do the same thing now can this point capture this pawn no they're stuck we know that pawns only capture diagonally but then the white pieces are going to deploy this bishop to discord and i want you to to tell me something which of the black pieces are being attacked by this bishop right now well i hope you you got it right and only this pawn is being attacked by the bishop so i could go diagonally and take it of course if it was white to move but it's black to move and let's say they go night over here so i still don't want to get the pawn because if i do this king is going to capture my bishop so i'm not ready ready for it yet i'm going to do my next move and i'm going to bring the queen to attack the same pawn so where can i put my queen so that it attacks this pawn there are two ways you could go all the way here and now you're attacking the pawn with the help of the bishop or you could go all the way diagonally and from there you're attacking the same part now i'm going to choose to go here now two pieces are attacking the same pawn and let's say they go bishop over here so now i've done one two three moves and i told you this is the four move checkmate so my next move has to be checkmate how can i do it well i'm going to send one of these two pieces to capture this pawn and that should be checkmate so the question is which one should i set should i send the queen or should i send the bishop let's take a look let's start with the bishop if the bishop goes in and takes he's attacking the king so at this point they say check now let's do cpr see he's captured can the king capture the bishop well the bishop is within the range of the king but there's one problem if the king captured that bishop he'll be in check by the queen and that's not allowed in chess the king cannot get himself into check so that's not an option c doesn't work p is protect there's no even room for for any piece of getting between the king and the bishop and r is run away can the king run away yes he could go here and the bishop cannot attack him anymore because the bishop only attacks diagonally so that's the reason why this is checked but not checkmate now what if we go in with the queen well if the queen takes cpr well i'm putting him in check first of all now they have to get out of check notice that if they try to move let's say this queen they can't because even if they try to move the queen they'll still be in check that cannot happen so let's do cpr c is captured can anyone capture the queen well only the king could but he can't because the bishop is being a helper he cannot get himself into check p is protect same thing no one can get in the way of the queen and the king and then finally we have r run away so the king could only run here here but in this case the queen is also attacking these two squares remember that the queen is the most powerful piece it attacks in every direction so now i'm putting the king in check but i'm also preventing the king from going to any of these two squares and this is checkmate so let me do it all the way from the very beginning so they move the pawn then they deploy the bishop then the queen and finally they go with the queen and they deliver checkmate just like that all that was captured was a little pawn but since the king is in check and he cannot escape it then it's going to be checkmate okay guys now you are ready to play your first game and that's exactly what we're going to do in the next lesson we're just going to play a game you're going to see me playing the game and explaining the different moves and hopefully we get a nice checkmate to to win the game at this point that's all you should be doing practice practice practice and practice the most important thing now is that you acquire vision of the board and the vision of the board is basically being able to detect uh when you could attack one of your opponent's pieces where you could capture one of your opponent's pieces and of course when one of your opponent's pieces uh could capture one of yours so how do you get that vision of the board well just by playing more you have to develop that skill and and that's all it takes so with that being said i will see you guys in the next lesson
