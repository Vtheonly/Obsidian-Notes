hello everyone it's time to learn how the chest piece is captured so for that I'm going to show you a quick position because I think you guys already know how to capture with your chest pieces so basically the works the bishops the night the King the Queen's they all capture the same way they move and with this position I'm going to show you that you really know what to do the knight is the one that could be a little bit tricky but you see it's not it's not a big deal and then I didn't mention the pants because pawns from the only pieces that do not capture the same way they move but it's going to be easy as well so let's get started with Brooks Oh Brooks if you went over lesson number one and lesson number two you know how the group moves now how do they capture well they're going to capture anything that is in their path anything that is in the way so let's identify the rooks if I look at the white rooks I have one here and one here this rook if I move all the way up I see there is a black bishop in the way so my rook could just move up and capture that bishop in chess when you capture something you're just going to replace it with your own piece that's it that's how the rook is going to capture now can I go over that bishop and capture this work no we learned that rooks can not jump over pieces only the Knights can jump over other piece and also in chess you cannot capture two pieces at the same time any time you capture it's going to be one piece so this rook can then move to the side can move down but there's nothing and I could move up and catch with this bishop now let me take a look at the other Brooke this work well side to side there's Queen King they're friends but if I look up there's a knight so my room could again go up and I captured a knight now let me see bishops so I have two bishops this Bishop captures as it moves so he moves diagonally I could just go dark dark direct or torque torque and I capture the knight can I capture this or the bishop not in one can I jump over tonight to get the bishop so I can only capture this night how about the other bishop oh this way in this way this old friends same team but if I look this way there's a direct pawn so I could just go diagonally and I captured the pond let's see the Queen well the White Queen cannot capture anything all of these pieces are in the same team so the Queen can not capture anything the King well he can only move to these squares there's nothing there because this other two squares even though he can move to them they're occupied by one of his friends so what else Knights what Knights I said there are a little bit trickier because even though they capture as they move they can only capture the piece that they land on and what what do I mean whoa look at these night Francis this night could go one two and three and he could capture this Knight but he can only capture that night they wonder his landing on even though he's going after the bishop after the pawn he did nothing to those pieces he only captures the one that he's going to land up that's it if I look at the Dark Knight well he could go one two three capture this pawn or he could go one two three and capture the other part but this one over here is going to remain where it is I could take this point or I could take this pawn this rooks cannot capture anything they're not attacking any of the white pieces but look at the screen this Queen could just go diagonally and capture the white pawn so I could go dark direct or authority and I captured upon it's not letting me capture with the black pieces because it's white to move but if I made a move like like this no the Queen could just go like that black pieces to move and they could capture the pawn oh I forgot the the black King so the black King he could actually capture something right now he could move to any square this right next one and look at this this Knight is one of his opponent's pieces so he could just go like that and capture it's it now the only one I didn't talk about is the pawn pawns we learn that they move straight forward only once that when they are at the very beginning like this point he could move one or he could move too but how do they capture well pawns capture one step but diagonally take the bishop so this point is the only point for the white pieces that could capture right now so he can not capture forward that's not how he captures that he could go diagonally so I go like this and I take the point oh it's uh it's actually now it's gonna be white pieces to move so if the white pieces go they're going to capture this point that's it now these two pawns they could capture the white pawn they could capture diagonally this one could move forward if he doesn't want to capture or he could capture diagonal light to light and now we're going to do what we call the pawns game the pawns game is basically just for you to really practice how the pawns move we're not gonna move the kings just pawns just redo get to get an idea so why peace is always stored in a game of chess so I'm going to start with this point he's at the very beginning so I'm going to choose to move two steps now black pieces could go one two now can I capture the pawn no bones do not capture forward these two points are stuck they can only move forward they can only go diagonally to capture so now let's say this way to move they go here no step two steps and not look the black pawn could choose to just capture my phone that's how they captured move forward but he stuck now he could just capture me now notice that he can not go this way because there's nothing there for him to capture so he only goes diagonally to capture something so capture now the white piece is captured back I say they move this pawn this point say this point is blocking this point you cannot capture show a liquid just blocking so this one is going to move up this one moves here here just moving power now if I move this pawn now two steps or any of these two pawns could capture it I could go like this or I could go directly in this case I'm going to choose this point then this one could capture me I got your back it's a big move up now I'm going to use this point it's a question can this pawn capture this pawn oh yes they could just go diagonally let's say I move this point forward can this point capture me no this one is coming this way so he can never go back not to move not to capture however this point he could easily capture me and if I could if I keep going and again it's another opportunity for you to capture I could capture back I could keep going so goes here takes takes now and just for the sake of getting all of the points of the board I'm going to start using Kings move forward then the black King captures the last fun and I hope even though this was fast I hope it gives you a better sense of how the pawns move and don't worry about it if you still feel like you have questions because we're going to be doing check and checkmate next and we're gonna play a first game as you play the game it's going to just become really easy to see how the pieces move they have they capture
