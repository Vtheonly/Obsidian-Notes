In Vim, `w`, `e`, and `b` are motion commands used to move the cursor within the text. Here's the difference between them:

1. **`w` (word)**:
   - Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
   - A word is typically defined by alphanumeric characters separated by whitespace or punctuation.
   - If the cursor is currently at the start of a word, `w` moves to the start of the next word.

2. **`e` (end)**:
   - Moves the cursor to the end of the current word.
   - If the cursor is already at the end of a word, `e` moves to the end of the next word.
   - The end of a word is the last character of the word, before any whitespace or punctuation.

3. **`b` (back)**:
   - Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current word.
   - If the cursor is at the beginning of a word, `b` moves to the beginning of the previous word.

### Examples

Assume the text is as follows, with the cursor starting at `|`:

```
This is a test sentence.
```

- If the cursor is at `|T` in `This`:

  - `w` will move the cursor to `|i` in `is`.
  - `e` will move the cursor to `|s` in `This`.
  - `b` will not move the cursor because it is already at the beginning of the word.

- If the cursor is at `|s` in `This`:

  - `w` will move the cursor to `|i` in `is`.
  - `e` will move the cursor to `|s` in `This`.
  - `b` will move the cursor to `|T` in `This`.

- If the cursor is at `|e` in `sentence`:

  - `w` will move the cursor to `|.`
  - `e` will move the cursor to `|e` in `sentence`.
  - `b` will move the cursor to `|c` in `sentence`.

These motion commands are very useful for navigating text efficiently in Vim and can be combined with other commands to perform more complex text manipulations.
