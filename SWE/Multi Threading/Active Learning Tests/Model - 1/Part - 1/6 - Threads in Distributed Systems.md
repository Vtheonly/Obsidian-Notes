# Quiz on Threads in Distributed Systems

Please select the correct option for each question.

### Questions

1. What is a **pop-up thread** in the context of distributed systems?
   - [ ] A) A thread that runs in the background
   - [ ] B) A thread created only when a request arrives
   - [ ] C) A thread that is pre-allocated in memory
   - [ ] D) A thread that handles only I/O operations

2. What is a primary advantage of using pop-up threads?
   - [ ] A) They can run indefinitely
   - [ ] B) They have a longer execution time
   - [ ] C) The latency between request arrival and processing start is very short
   - [ ] D) They require less memory than regular threads

3. In which space is it generally faster to create a pop-up thread?
   - [ ] A) User space
   - [ ] B) Kernel space
   - [ ] C) Virtual space
   - [ ] D) Shared memory space

4. What is a potential downside of creating threads in the kernel space?
   - [ ] A) It consumes more CPU resources
   - [ ] B) A bug in a kernel thread can lead to severe system problems
   - [ ] C) It is more difficult to manage user data
   - [ ] D) It requires additional configuration

5. Why might using pop-up threads be beneficial in server applications?
   - [ ] A) They increase the serverâ€™s uptime
   - [ ] B) They can handle requests more efficiently
   - [ ] C) They reduce the need for inter-thread communication
   - [ ] D) They eliminate the need for locking mechanisms

6. When a pop-up thread is created, what does it lack?
   - [ ] A) The ability to communicate with other threads
   - [ ] B) Any history (registers, stack, etc.) to restore
   - [ ] C) Access to I/O devices
   - [ ] D) Memory allocation

7. What planning consideration is necessary when implementing pop-up threads?
   - [ ] A) The maximum number of threads allowed
   - [ ] B) The scheduling policy of the operating system
   - [ ] C) The location of thread creation (user/kernel space)
   - [ ] D) The duration of thread execution

8. In distributed systems, what often causes threads to remain blocked?
   - [ ] A) Waiting for a request to be processed
   - [ ] B) Memory allocation issues
   - [ ] C) Lack of CPU resources
   - [ ] D) Networking delays
