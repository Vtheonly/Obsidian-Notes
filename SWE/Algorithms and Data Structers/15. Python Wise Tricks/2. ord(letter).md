## Expression: `ord(letter) - ord("a")`

### What It Does

The expression `ord(letter) - ord("a")` computes the **zero-based alphabetical index** of a lowercase English letter.

---

### How It Works

The `ord()` function returns the **Unicode code point** (an integer) for a given character.

- `ord("a")` returns `97`
    
- `ord("b")` returns `98`
    
- `ord("z")` returns `122`
    

So, for example:

```python
ord("c") - ord("a")  # → 99 - 97 = 2
```

This means:

- `"a"` → `0`
    
- `"b"` → `1`
    
- `"c"` → `2`
    
- ...
    
- `"z"` → `25`

### Why Use This?

This is very useful when:

1. **Indexing** into arrays where `'a'` should correspond to index 0.
    
    ```python
    counts = [0] * 26
    letter = "e"
    counts[ord(letter) - ord("a")] += 1
    ```
    
2. **Mapping letters to positions** in the alphabet.
    
    ```python
    def letter_position(l):
        return ord(l) - ord("a")
    ```
    
3. **Compression or encoding schemes** that treat letters as numbers.
    
    ```python
    def encode(text):
        return [ord(c) - ord("a") for c in text.lower() if c.isalpha()]
    ```
    

---

### Example

```python
text = "banana"
positions = [ord(c) - ord("a") for c in text]
print(positions)  # Output: [1, 0, 13, 0, 13, 0]
```

This gives you the index of each letter as it appears in the alphabet, starting from 0.

---

### Caveats

- This only works reliably with **lowercase** letters. If you're working with uppercase letters, convert them first with `.lower()` or handle them separately.
    
- Assumes English alphabet; does not generalize to Unicode letters outside A–Z/a–z.

Let me know if you want the reverse operation using `chr()` or more on character encodings.
