# LeetCode 242: Valid Anagram - Character Counting (Python)

**Problem:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Core Technique:** Character Frequency Array / Hash Map

**Algorithm Overview:**
1.  **Edge Case (Length Check):** If the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, they cannot be anagrams. Return `False`.
2.  **Initialize Frequency Array:** Create an array (e.g., `count_all`) of size 26 (for lowercase English letters), initialized to all zeros. This array will store the frequency of each character.
3.  **Populate for String `s`:** Iterate through string `s`. For each character, increment its corresponding count in the frequency array. The index is typically calculated using `ord(char) - ord('a')`.
4.  **Decrement for String `t`:** Iterate through string `t`. For each character, decrement its corresponding count in the frequency array.
5.  **Verify Frequencies:** After processing both strings, if `s` and `t` are anagrams, all counts in the frequency array should be zero. Check if the `count_all` array is equal to an array of 26 zeros.

## Python Implementation (LeetCode)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False # Essential pre-check

        # Initialize a frequency array for 26 lowercase English letters
        count_all = [0] * 26

        # Increment counts for characters in s
        for char_s in s:
            count_all[ord(char_s) - ord('a')] += 1

        # Decrement counts for characters in t
        for char_t in t:
            count_all[ord(char_t) - ord('a')] -= 1

        # If s and t are anagrams, all counts should be zero
        # This can be checked by comparing to an array of zeros,
        # or by iterating and checking each element.
        return count_all == [0] * 26

        # Alternative verification:
        # for count in count_all:
        #     if count != 0:
        #         return False
        # return True
```

## Key Techniques & Concepts:

*   **Frequency Array (Character Counting):**
    *   Uses a fixed-size array (e.g., 26 for lowercase English alphabet, 128 for ASCII, 256 for extended ASCII) to store the counts of each character.
    *   Efficient for a known, limited character set.
*   **ASCII Offset for Indexing:**
    *   `ord(char) - ord('a')`: This common trick converts a lowercase character (`char`) into an integer index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `ord()` gives the ASCII (or Unicode) value of a character.
*   **Length Pre-check:** A fundamental optimization. If lengths differ, they can't be anagrams.
*   **Increment/Decrement Strategy:** By incrementing for one string and decrementing for the other, a resulting array of all zeros indicates a perfect match in character frequencies.

## Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N + M + A) where N is `len(s)`, M is `len(t)`, and A is the alphabet size (26 in this case). This simplifies to O(N) if N=M, as the iteration through the count array is constant time. If we consider the string lengths as dominant, it's O(len(s) + len(t)).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(A) where A is the alphabet size (26). This is O(1) because the size of the `count_all` array is constant and does not depend on the input string lengths.

**Note on the Java image provided earlier:**
The Java code snippet from the image `charCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++; charCounts[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;` performs the increment and decrement in a *single loop*, assuming `s` and `t` are of the same length (which should be checked beforehand). The Python solution here uses two separate loops but achieves the same logical outcome. Both rely on the `char - 'a'` (or `ord(char) - ord('a')`) indexing trick.
