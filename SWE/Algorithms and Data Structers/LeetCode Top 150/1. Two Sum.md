# LeetCode 1:  - Hash Map (Python)

**Problem:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have *exactly one solution*, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Core Technique:** Hash Map (Dictionary in Python) for Efficient Lookups

**Algorithm Overview:**
1.  **Initialize Hash Map:** Create an empty hash map (dictionary) called `seen`. This map will store `number: index` pairs encountered so far.
2.  **Iterate Through Numbers:** Loop through the `nums` array, getting both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each element.
3.  **Calculate Complement:** For each `num`, calculate the `complement` needed to reach the `target` (i.e., `complement = target - num`).
4.  **Check for Complement in Hash Map:**
    *   If the `complement` is already a key in the `seen` hash map, it means we have previously encountered the other number that, when added to the current `num`, sums up to the `target`.
    *   Return the index of the `complement` (which is `seen[complement]`) and the current index `i`.
5.  **Store Current Number:** If the `complement` is not found in `seen`, add the current `num` and its index `i` to the `seen` map (`seen[num] = i`). This is done so that future numbers can check if the current `num` is their complement.
6.  **No Solution (Optional):** If the loop completes without finding a pair, it means no two numbers sum to the target (though the problem statement usually guarantees one solution). The provided code returns an empty list `[]` in this case, which is good practice.

## Python Implementation (LeetCode)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        seen = {} # Hash map to store {number: index}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in seen:
                # Found the complement in previously seen numbers
                return [seen[complement], i]
            # If complement not found, store the current number and its index
            seen[num] = i
        return [] # Should not be reached if one solution is guaranteed
```

## Key Techniques & Concepts:

*   **Hash Map (Dictionary):**
    *   Used to store numbers encountered so far and their indices.
    *   Provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups (checking if `complement in seen`) and insertions (`seen[num] = i`).
*   **One-Pass Solution:** The algorithm iterates through the array only once. As it processes each element, it checks if its complement has already been seen. If not, it stores the current element for future checks.
*   **Complement Calculation:** The core idea is to find `target - current_number`.
*   **`enumerate()`:** A Python built-in function that allows iterating over an iterable (like a list) while also getting the index of each item.

## Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list once, and hash map operations (insertion and lookup) take O(1) on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case, as the `seen` hash map might store up to N-1 elements if the target pair is found at the very end (or all N elements if no pair is found and all numbers are unique).
