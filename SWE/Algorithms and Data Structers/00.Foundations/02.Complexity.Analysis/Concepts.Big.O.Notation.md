# Big (O) – Time and Space Complexity

## Definitions

**Time Complexity:** describes the amount of time necessary to execute an algorithm

**Space Complexity:** describes amount of memory or space utilized by an algorithm/program

**Both** – asymptotically

## Big O Notation

In computer science, big O notation is used to describe algorithms according to **how fast they run** (time complexity) or **how much space they take** (space complexity) **as the input size grows**.

**Technical Definition:** Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

**Why do we need Big O?** Big O notation helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows, providing a simple way to compare and analyse different algorithms' efficiency.

## Time Complexity Chart (Conceptual)

**(Image of a graph with 'time' on the y-axis and 'input size' on the x-axis)**

*   A red line labeled "slow" shows a steep upward curve, indicating time increases rapidly with input size.
*   A green line labeled "fast" shows a much flatter curve, indicating time increases slowly with input size.
