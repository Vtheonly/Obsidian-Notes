It seems like you're breaking down a video tutorial about the difference between a **constant pointer** and a **pointer to a constant** in C. Let's distill the main concepts discussed and summarize them clearly.

### 1. **Constant Pointer (`T* const ptr`)**
- **Syntax**: `T* const ptr`
- **Behavior**: 
  - The **pointer itself** is constant, meaning you cannot change the memory address it points to after initialization.
  - You **can modify** the value stored at the address (as long as the value is not `const` itself).
  
  ```c
  char a = 'a';
  char b = 'b';
  char* const ptr = &a; // Constant pointer to 'a'

  *ptr = 'x';          // Allowed: modifying the value at 'a'
  ptr = &b;            // Error: changing the address ptr points to is not allowed
  ```

### 2. **Pointer to a Constant (`const T* ptr`)**
- **Syntax**: `const T* ptr` or `T const* ptr`
- **Behavior**:
  - The **value** the pointer is pointing to is constant, so you cannot change it through the pointer.
  - However, the **pointer itself** is not constant, so you can change the address it points to.

  ```c
  char a = 'a';
  char b = 'b';
  const char* ptr = &a; // Pointer to a constant

  *ptr = 'x';          // Error: cannot modify the value at 'a'
  ptr = &b;            // Allowed: changing the address the pointer points to
  ```

### 3. **Constant Pointer to a Constant (`const T* const ptr`)**
- **Syntax**: `const T* const ptr` or `T const* const ptr`
- **Behavior**: 
  - Both the **pointer** and the **value** it points to are constant.
  - You can neither change the address it points to nor the value stored at that address.

  ```c
  char a = 'a';
  char b = 'b';
  const char* const ptr = &a; // Constant pointer to a constant

  *ptr = 'x';           // Error: cannot modify the value at 'a'
  ptr = &b;             // Error: cannot change the pointer itself
  ```

### Summary Table

| Pointer Type                       | Can Change Pointer Address? | Can Change Pointed Value? |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `T*` (Non-constant pointer)        | Yes                         | Yes                        |
| `const T*` (Pointer to constant)   | Yes                         | No                         |
| `T* const` (Constant pointer)      | No                          | Yes                        |
| `const T* const` (Constant pointer to constant) | No                | No                         |

### Conclusion
The difference lies in the placement of `const`:
- **`T* const ptr`**: You cannot change the pointer itself, but you can change the value it points to.
- **`const T* ptr`**: You cannot change the value it points to, but you can change the pointer itself.
- **`const T* const ptr`**: You cannot change either the pointer or the value it points to.

This distinction is subtle but crucial for managing memory and data immutability in C programs.
