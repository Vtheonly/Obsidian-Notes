## ðŸ”§ Priority Queue (Heap) in Java

### âœ… Correction & Clarification

The image shows a **min-heap** created using `PriorityQueue` in Java, where elements are ordered based on a frequency map `count`. This lambda comparator `(a, b) -> count.get(a) - count.get(b)` ensures that elements with lower counts have higher priority (appear first).

---

## ðŸ“˜ Definition

> **Priority Queue** is an abstract data structure where each element has a priority assigned to it. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.

In Java, `PriorityQueue` uses a **heap-based** implementation (binary heap by default), and is part of the **java.util** package.

---

## ðŸ§± Syntax

```java
Queue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> count.get(a) - count.get(b));
```

Here:

- `Queue<Integer>` is the interface.
    
- `PriorityQueue<>` is the heap-based implementation.
    
- The lambda comparator defines the priority by **custom rules**.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Default Behavior

- Java's `PriorityQueue` behaves as a **min-heap** by default.
    
- Elements are ordered using their **natural ordering** (i.e., smallest value has the highest priority).
    

### Custom Behavior (as in the image)

- A **custom comparator** `(a, b) -> count.get(a) - count.get(b)` is used.
    
- This makes the queue **prioritize lower frequency elements** (common in problems like _top K frequent elements_, _reorganize strings_, etc.).

## ðŸ§® Example

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
count.put(1, 3);
count.put(2, 1);
count.put(3, 2);

Queue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> count.get(a) - count.get(b));

heap.offer(1);
heap.offer(2);
heap.offer(3);

while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.print(heap.poll() + " ");
}
```

### ðŸ”½ Output:

```
2 3 1
```

Why? Because:

- `2` has frequency `1`
    
- `3` has frequency `2`
    
- `1` has frequency `3`
    

Lower frequency = higher priority.

## ðŸ§° Use Cases

- Huffman Encoding
    
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
    
- Top K Frequent Elements
    
- Task Scheduling
    
- Load Balancing
    

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Tips

- Min-heap: `(a, b) -> a - b`
    
- Max-heap: `(a, b) -> b - a` or use `Collections.reverseOrder()`
    
- Custom objects: Provide comparator on the desired field
    
- Time Complexity:
    
    - `add()`, `poll()`, `peek()` â†’ **O(log n)**
        

---

## ðŸ“Ž Visual: Min-Heap Behavior

```
        2
       / \
      3   1
```

In a priority queue with custom comparator based on frequency, logical heap structure changes based on `count.get(value)`.
