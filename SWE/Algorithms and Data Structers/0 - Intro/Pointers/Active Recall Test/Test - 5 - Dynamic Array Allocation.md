Here is a 12-question quiz with multiple choice answers based on your C examples and concepts of dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and dereferencing:

### Quiz: Pointers, Memory Allocation, and Dereferencing in C

1. **What does the `&` operator in C do?**
   - [ ] A) Dereferences a pointer
   - [ ] B) Allocates memory dynamically
   - [ ] C) Returns the address of a variable
   - [ ] D) Frees allocated memory

2. **What is the output of this code?**
   ```c
   int x = 5;
   int *p = &x;
   printf("%d", *p);
   ```
   - [ ] A) Address of `x`
   - [ ] B) 5
   - [ ] C) Random number
   - [ ] D) Compilation error

3. **Which function is used to allocate memory dynamically in C?**
   - [ ] A) `malloc`
   - [ ] B) `scanf`
   - [ ] C) `printf`
   - [ ] D) `free`

4. **What does `free(a)` do in the code?**
   - [ ] A) Frees the pointer variable
   - [ ] B) Releases the memory allocated by `malloc`
   - [ ] C) Reinitializes the pointer to NULL
   - [ ] D) Assigns 0 to all elements of the array

5. **What happens if you access memory that has already been freed?**
   - [ ] A) Undefined behavior
   - [ ] B) Safe access to old values
   - [ ] C) Memory leak
   - [ ] D) Compilation error

6. **Which of the following correctly represents the pointer dereference operation?**
   - [ ] A) `*a`
   - [ ] B) `&a`
   - [ ] C) `a*`
   - [ ] D) `a&`

7. **What is the correct way to declare a pointer to an integer?**
   - [ ] A) `int p*;`
   - [ ] B) `int *p;`
   - [ ] C) `int &p;`
   - [ ] D) `int p;`

8. **If `a` is a pointer to an integer, how would you access the value it points to?**
   - [ ] A) `a`
   - [ ] B) `&a`
   - [ ] C) `*a`
   - [ ] D) `**a`

9. **Which of the following expressions assigns the address of variable `x` to pointer `p`?**
   - [ ] A) `p = *x;`
   - [ ] B) `p = &x;`
   - [ ] C) `*p = x;`
   - [ ] D) `x = &p;`

10. **What will happen if the following code is executed and `malloc` fails?**
    ```c
    int *a = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    ```
    - [ ] A) `a` will be set to NULL
    - [ ] B) The program will crash
    - [ ] C) `a` will be initialized to random values
    - [ ] D) The program will continue without issues

11. **What is the equivalent pointer notation for `a[i]`?**
    - [ ] A) `*a + i`
    - [ ] B) `a * i`
    - [ ] C) `*(a + i)`
    - [ ] D) `*(i + a)`

12. **What does the following code output if the user inputs `3`?**
    ```c
    int length, *a;
    printf("Enter a length: ");
    scanf("%d", &length);
    a = malloc(length * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        a[i] = i;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        printf("a[%d]=%d\n", i, a[i]);
    free(a);
    ```
    - [ ] A) Memory address of each element
    - [ ] B) `a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=2`
    - [ ] C) Compilation error
    - [ ] D) Garbage values
