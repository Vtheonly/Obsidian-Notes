Yesâ€”what you're experiencing is **expected**, but definitely annoying when you're not expecting it.

Let me explain **why this happens**, and how to **prevent it or control it** in VS Code.

## ðŸ§  Why does "Step Over" go into complex built-in or external files?

Even though you pressed **Step Over**, sometimes:

- It looks like it **steps _into_** something (like `console.log`, or a library function),
    
- And suddenly you're in a file like `node_modules/something.js` or some built-in code like `internal/modules/...` or even browser/Node.js core source.
    

This happens because **Step Over doesnâ€™t _always_ avoid stepping into external/native code** unless VS Code is told to.

Sometimes the function is **async** or **wrapped**, and the debugger doesn't clearly distinguish between your code and library code (especially in JS).

---

## ðŸ”§ How to fix or reduce this:

Hereâ€™s how to keep the debugger focused on **your own code only**.

### 1. **Set `smartStep` in your launch config**

In `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Launch Program",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
  "smartStep": true,
  "skipFiles": [
    "<node_internals>/**",
    "node_modules/**"
  ]
}
```

- `smartStep`: tries to step over code you didnâ€™t write (like transpiled or wrapped code).
    
- `skipFiles`: tells VS Code to ignore stepping into:
    
    - Nodeâ€™s internal files (`<node_internals>/**`)
        
    - External libraries (`node_modules/**`)
        

### 2. **Use "Step Over" only on clear simple lines**

Some lines look simple but call complex internal functions. Example:

```js
await fetch(url); // Might step into internal polyfills or async handlers
```

To avoid stepping into that, either:

- Set breakpoints **after** that line.
    
- Or add `skipFiles` so it avoids known externals.

## âœ… Pro Tips

- **F10 (Step Over)** will still enter files **if the function behaves asynchronously**, unless guarded by `skipFiles`.
    
- You can **hover over the yellow arrow** to see where exactly the debugger thinks it is.
    
- If you ever get "lost", press **Shift+F5** to stop debugging and reset.

## ðŸ§ª Example Behavior

```js
function customLogger(message) {
  console.log(message); // Can go into internal console code!
}

customLogger("Hello Marshal"); // You step here
```

If you press **F10 here**, VS Code might still jump into `console.js` or even `tty.js` inside Node internalsâ€”unless `skipFiles` is set.
