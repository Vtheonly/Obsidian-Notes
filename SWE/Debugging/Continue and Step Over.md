You're hitting on a very common point of confusion when learning debuggers! The difference between "Continue" and "Step Over" is subtle but crucial, and it mostly revolves around **how they handle function calls** and **where they stop next**.

Let's break it down with your `app.js` example:

```javascript
// app.js
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Entering greet function"); // Line 2
    let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"; // Line 3
    console.log(greeting); // Line 4
    console.log("Exiting greet function"); // Line 5
    return greeting; // Line 6
}

function processUser(user) {
    console.log("Processing user:", user.name); // Line 10
    // <<< LET'S SAY THE DEBUGGER IS PAUSED HERE, ON LINE 11 >>>
    let message = greet(user.name); // Line 11
    console.log("Message received from greet:", message); // Line 12
    if (user.isAdmin) { // Line 13
        console.log(user.name + " is an admin."); // Line 14
    }
    console.log("Finished processing user:", user.name); // Line 16
}

console.log("Script starting..."); // Line 19
let user1 = { name: "Alice", isAdmin: false }; // Line 21
processUser(user1); // Line 24
console.log("Script finished."); // Line 29
```

**Scenario:** The debugger is currently paused at **Line 11** inside the `processUser` function: `let message = greet(user.name);`

---

### Step Over (↪️ / F10)

*   **What it does:** It executes the *entire current line* (Line 11).
    *   Because Line 11 contains a call to the `greet()` function, "Step Over" will:
        1.  Execute the `greet(user.name)` function completely, from its beginning (Line 2) to its end (Line 6).
        2.  You **will NOT see** the debugger move line-by-line *inside* the `greet()` function. It's like `greet()` happens in a black box from your current perspective.
        3.  The return value from `greet()` (e.g., "Hello, Alice!") will be assigned to the `message` variable.
    *   After Line 11 is fully executed (including the entire `greet()` call), the debugger will pause on the **very next line of code within the current function (`processUser`)**.
*   **Where it stops next:** Line 12 (`console.log("Message received from greet:", message);`).

**Think of "Step Over" as saying:** "I trust this function call on this line (`greet()`), or I don't care about its internal details right now. Just execute it, get its result, and take me to the next line *in this current `processUser` function*."

---

### Continue (▶️ / F5)

*   **What it does:** It resumes program execution and tells the debugger to run freely **until it hits the next breakpoint you've set, OR until the program finishes.**
    *   When you're paused at Line 11 and press "Continue":
        1.  The `greet(user.name)` function will be called and will execute.
        2.  Then, Line 12 (`console.log("Message received from greet:", message);`) will execute.
        3.  Then, Line 13 (`if (user.isAdmin)`) will execute, and so on.
        4.  The entire rest of the `processUser` function will execute.
        5.  Then, Line 29 (`console.log("Script finished.");`) will execute.
*   **Where it stops next:**
    *   If you have **another breakpoint set somewhere later** (e.g., if you had a breakpoint on Line 29), it would stop there.
    *   If you have **no other breakpoints**, the entire script will run to completion, and the debugging session will end.
    *   **Crucially:** It does *not* automatically stop on Line 12 just because it's the next line. It's looking for the *next explicit stop signal* (a breakpoint).

**Think of "Continue" as saying:** "I'm done looking at this specific spot. Let the program run, and only stop me again if I've specifically marked another place with a breakpoint, or if the whole thing is done."

---

**Analogy:**

Imagine you're following a recipe (your program).

*   You're at a step: "Prepare the special sauce (see page 5 for sauce recipe)." This is Line 11, where `greet()` is called.

*   **Step Over:** You say, "Okay, I'll assume the sauce recipe on page 5 is fine. I'll just make the sauce quickly without looking at each step of the sauce recipe, and then I'll come back to the *next step in this main recipe*."
    *   You (magically) make the sauce.
    *   You pause at the next instruction in your main recipe: "Add sauce to the dish." (This is like Line 12).

*   **Continue:** You say, "Okay, I'm going to keep cooking. I'll make the sauce, add it to the dish, and then continue with all the remaining steps of the main recipe until I either finish the whole meal or reach another point where I've put a sticky note saying 'Pause here and check.'"
    *   You make the sauce, add it to the dish, bake it, serve it... you do everything.
    *   You only stop if you hit that "Pause here" sticky note (another breakpoint) or if the meal is complete.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature         | Step Over (↪️ / F10)                                                              | Continue (▶️ / F5)                                        |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function Call** | Executes the entire function *without* stepping into its lines.                    | Executes the function and keeps going.                    |
| **Stopping Point**| The **very next line** in the current function/scope.                              | The **next breakpoint** or the **end of the program**.      |
| **Control**     | More granular control *within* the current function, skipping over internals of calls. | Less granular; lets the program run more freely.          |

So, if you're on a line with a function call:
*   Use **Step Over** if you want to execute that function and immediately stop on the line *after* the function call *in your current context*.
*   Use **Continue** if you want the program to run until it hits another breakpoint you've deliberately set, or until it finishes.
*   (And use **Step Into** if you actually want to go *inside* that function call and debug it line-by-line).
