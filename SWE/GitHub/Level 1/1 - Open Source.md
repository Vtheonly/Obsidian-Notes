"Open source" refers to a software development and distribution model where the source code of a software application is made available to the public. Here's what it means and how it works:

1. **Open Source Definition:** Open source software is characterized by its availability for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. This is made possible by providing access to the underlying source code, which is the human-readable code used to create the software.

2. **Finding the Source:** The source code for open source software is typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or other version control repositories. Anyone can access and view the code from these platforms.

3. **Modifying the Source:** When you have access to the source code, you can make changes to it. This means you can modify the functionality, fix bugs, or adapt the software to your specific needs. This is often a fundamental aspect of open source, allowing for customization.

4. **Contributing to the App:** If you make changes to the source code, you can contribute your modifications back to the project. This is how open source software communities grow and improve. By sharing your changes, you help enhance the original application.

5. **Understanding How the App Works:** Understanding how an application works is indeed one of the benefits of open source. Developers can learn from existing codebases, improve their skills, and gain insights into software development best practices.

6. **Community Collaboration:** Open source is not just about making changes to the "real version" but also about collaboration and community involvement. Many open source projects are developed by communities of volunteers who work together to create and maintain software that benefits everyone.

7. **License Matters:** Open source software often comes with licenses that dictate how you can use, modify, and distribute the software. It's essential to comply with these licenses to ensure that your use of open source software is legal and ethical.

The main point of open source is to provide transparency, accessibility, and the freedom to use, modify, and contribute to software. This fosters innovation, allows for collective problem-solving, and promotes collaboration among developers and users. While you can change the source code, the ultimate goal is not just customization but also the improvement and democratization of software development.
