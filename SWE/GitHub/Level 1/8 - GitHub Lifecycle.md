You have a good understanding of the basic GitHub/Git life cycle. I'll provide a summary of each step for clarity:

1. **Create Local Files:** Start by creating a folder and adding files to it. These files constitute your project or codebase.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Use the "git clone" command to download an entire remote repository (usually hosted on GitHub) to your local machine. This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

3. **Add Changes:** Use the "git add" command to stage the changes you want to include in your next commit. Staging allows you to select specific files or changes to be included in the commit.

4. **Commit Changes:** Use the "git commit" command to save the staged changes as a commit with a meaningful commit message. Commits are like checkpoints in your project's history.

5. **Push Changes:** Use the "git push" command to upload your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub. This makes your changes accessible to others and helps keep the remote repository up to date.

6. **Pull Changes:** Use the "git pull" command to fetch and integrate changes made by others in the remote repository into your local copy. This is essential for keeping your local copy synchronized with the latest updates from collaborators.

Your summarized life cycle provides a good foundation for working with Git and GitHub, and it's a fundamental workflow for collaborating on software development projects.
