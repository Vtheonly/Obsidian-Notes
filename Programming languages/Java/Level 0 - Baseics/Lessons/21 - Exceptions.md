### Introduction
In this video, we'll cover how to handle exceptions in Java effectively. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of program execution. By understanding how to manage exceptions, we can ensure that our applications run smoothly without crashing due to unexpected errors.

### Key Concepts

- **Exception:** An unexpected event during program execution that interrupts the flow of instructions (e.g., division by zero).
- **Try-Catch Block:** A construct used to handle exceptions gracefully. Code that may throw an exception is placed in a `try` block, and handling for specific exceptions is done in `catch` blocks.
- **Finally Block:** A block that executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred, often used for cleanup activities.

### Example Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        try {
            System.out.print("Enter a whole number to divide: ");
            int x = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.print("Enter a whole number to divide by: ");
            int y = scanner.nextInt();
            int z = x / y;
            System.out.println("Result: " + z);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("You can't divide by zero, idiot!");
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("Please enter a number, OMFG!");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Something went wrong!");
        } finally {
            scanner.close();
            System.out.println("This will always print.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Scanner Initialization:**
   - A `Scanner` object is created to read input from the user.

2. **Try Block:**
   - Code that may throw an exception is placed here. If an exception occurs, control is transferred to the corresponding catch block.

3. **Catch Blocks:**
   - `ArithmeticException`: Catches division by zero errors.
   - `InputMismatchException`: Catches cases where the user inputs a non-integer value.
   - General `Exception`: Catches all other exceptions as a fallback.

4. **Finally Block:**
   - This block is executed regardless of whether an exception was caught or not. It is typically used for resource cleanup, such as closing the `Scanner`.

### Practical Examples
- **Divide by Zero:** 
  - If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program outputs a specific error message instead of crashing.

- **Invalid Input:**
  - If a user inputs a non-integer value, the program alerts the user without crashing.

### Actionable Tips
- Always use specific exceptions in catch blocks for better clarity and handling.
- Use the `finally` block to close resources such as files or database connections to prevent resource leaks.

### Conclusion
Understanding and handling exceptions is crucial for writing robust Java applications. By implementing `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, we can create programs that gracefully handle errors and continue running.

In Java, when dealing with exceptions, there are two primary types: **checked** and **unchecked** exceptions. Depending on the type of exception you are working with, you may need to declare it using the `throws` keyword in the class or method signature. Hereâ€™s how and why you would use `throws` and `throw`.

## Using `throws` and `throw` in Java

### 1. The `throws` Keyword

The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to indicate that the method can throw one or more exceptions. This is typically required for **checked exceptions** (exceptions that are checked at compile time), which must either be caught or declared in the method signature.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class ExampleClass {
    public void riskyMethod() throws IOException {
        // Code that may throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("File not found");
    }
}
```

In this example, `riskyMethod` is declared to throw `IOException`. This means that any method that calls `riskyMethod` must handle the exception using a try-catch block or also declare that it throws the exception.

### 2. The `throw` Keyword

The `throw` keyword is used to actually throw an exception in your code. You can use `throw` to create an instance of an exception and send it up the call stack.

#### Example

```java
public class ThrowExample {
    public void checkNumber(int number) {
        if (number < 1) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number must be greater than zero");
        }
        System.out.println("Valid number: " + number);
    }
}
```

In this example, if the provided number is less than 1, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

### Combining `throws` and `throw`

You can use both keywords in a single method when you need to throw exceptions that need to be declared.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileProcessor {
    public void processFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        if (fileName == null) {
            throw new IOException("File name cannot be null");
        }
        // Additional file processing logic here
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **`throws`**: Used in the method declaration to specify that the method may throw one or more exceptions.
- **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception in your code.

### Practical Usage

When designing your methods, if there is a possibility of encountering checked exceptions, declare them using `throws`. Use `throw` when you want to signal an error condition.

### Example Code

Here's a complete example that demonstrates both `throws` and `throw`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class ExceptionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExceptionDemo demo = new ExceptionDemo();
        try {
            demo.readFile(null); // This will cause an exception
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        if (fileName == null) {
            throw new IOException("File name cannot be null");
        }
        // Code to read the file would go here
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Understanding when to use `throws` and `throw` is essential for effective exception handling in Java. By properly declaring and throwing exceptions, you can create robust applications that can gracefully handle errors.
