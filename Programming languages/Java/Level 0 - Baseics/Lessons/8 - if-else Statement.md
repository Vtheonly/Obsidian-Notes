## `if-else` Statement in Java

### Overview

The `if-else` statement is a fundamental control flow construct in Java used to execute code based on specific conditions. It allows for decision-making in the code, enabling different code paths depending on the outcome of a boolean expression.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

### Components

1. **Condition**: A boolean expression that is evaluated to determine which block of code to execute. The condition must return `true` or `false`.

2. **If Block**: The block of code that executes when the condition is `true`.

3. **Else Block**: The block of code that executes when the condition is `false`. The `else` block is optional.

### Example

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero or negative.");
}
```

### Nested `if-else`

You can nest `if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions:

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.println("The number is positive and even.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The number is positive and odd.");
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero or negative.");
}
```

### `else if` Statement

The `else if` clause is used to test multiple conditions:

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else if (number < 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is negative.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
}
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for simple `if-else` statements. It is used to assign values based on a condition.

#### Syntax

```java
variable = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

#### Example

```java
int number = 10;
String result = (number > 0) ? "Positive" : "Non-positive";
System.out.println(result);
```

### Advanced Documentation

#### Conditions

- **Boolean Expressions**: Conditions in `if` statements can include boolean expressions, relational operators, and logical operators.
- **Comparison Operators**: Used for comparing values (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
- **Logical Operators**: Used to combine multiple conditions (e.g., `&&` for logical AND, `||` for logical OR, `!` for logical NOT).

#### Best Practices

- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Deeply nested `if-else` statements can be hard to read and maintain. Consider using switch statements or refactoring code into separate methods if nesting becomes too complex.
- **Use Meaningful Conditions**: Ensure that conditions are clear and meaningful to improve code readability.
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Java uses short-circuit evaluation for logical operators (`&&`, `||`). This means that the evaluation stops as soon as the result is determined.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Assignment vs. Comparison**: Ensure that you use `==` for comparison and `=` for assignment. Misusing these can lead to logical errors.
- **Always Check Edge Cases**: When dealing with multiple conditions, ensure that all possible edge cases are handled to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Example with Nested `if-else` and Ternary Operator

```java
int number = 15;

if (number > 0) {
    String result = (number % 2 == 0) ? "Positive and even" : "Positive and odd";
    System.out.println(result);
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero or negative.");
}
```

This example uses both nested `if-else` and the ternary operator to determine and print whether the number is positive and even or odd, or if it is zero or negative.
