In Java, **packages** and **libraries** are related but serve different purposes and exist at different levels of abstraction. Let's break down the differences and relationships between them:

### Package

- **Definition:** A package in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It provides a way to group related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations) together. This helps avoid naming conflicts and allows for better code organization and access control.
  
- **Usage:** Packages are used directly in your Java code by importing them. For example:
  ```java
  import java.util.List;
  ```
  Here, `java.util` is a package that contains the `List` interface.

- **Contains:** A package contains classes, interfaces, enums, and other packages (known as sub-packages).

### Library

- **Definition:** A library is a collection of precompiled classes, interfaces, and resources that can be used by your application to perform specific functions. A library typically comes in the form of a **JAR (Java ARchive)** file in Java.

- **Usage:** Libraries are not used directly like packages. Instead, you include a library in your project (e.g., adding a JAR file to your classpath), and then you can import the packages or classes within that library as needed.

- **Contains:** A library contains one or more packages, along with other resources such as configuration files, images, or documentation. Libraries are essentially a higher-level construct that bundles multiple packages together.

### Relationship Between Package and Library

- **Package within a Library:** A package is a smaller unit within a library. A single library can contain multiple packages, each of which groups related classes and interfaces.

- **Library Contains Packages:** Libraries are broader collections that may include multiple packages, each containing specific classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. When you add a library to your project, you gain access to all the packages and classes within that library.

### Example

Let's take the example of the Apache Commons library:

- **Library:** `Apache Commons Lang`
  - **Packages within this library:**
    - `org.apache.commons.lang3`
    - `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder`
    - `org.apache.commons.lang3.time`
    - ...and many more.

When you include the `Apache Commons Lang` library in your project, you can import any of the packages it contains and use the classes within those packages.

### Summary

- **Package:** A way to organize related classes and interfaces.
- **Library:** A collection of packages bundled together, often distributed as a JAR file.

**A library contains packages, and packages contain classes, interfaces, and other elements.**
