In Java, libraries are included or imported using the `import` statement. The Java Standard Library contains many commonly used libraries. Below is an overview of these libraries, along with some best practices for managing imports.

### Common Java Standard Libraries

1. **`java.util`:**
   - Provides utility classes such as collections (`List`, `Set`, `Map`), date and time utilities, and random number generation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.*;
     ```

2. **`java.io`:**
   - Handles input and output operations, including file I/O.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.io.*;
     ```

3. **`java.net`:**
   - Used for networking operations, such as working with URLs and sockets.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.net.*;
     ```

4. **`java.awt` and `javax.swing`:**
   - Used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.awt.*;
     import javax.swing.*;
     ```

5. **`java.sql`:**
   - Provides JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.sql.*;
     ```

6. **`java.math`:**
   - Contains classes for performing arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.math.*;
     ```

7. **`java.text`:**
   - Facilitates formatting and parsing text, dates, and numbers.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.text.*;
     ```

8. **`java.nio`:**
   - Supports non-blocking I/O operations, buffers, channels, and more.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.nio.*;
     ```

9. **`java.time`:**
   - Introduced in Java 8, this package contains classes for handling date and time.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.time.*;
     ```

### Importing Third-Party Libraries

For external libraries, download the JAR files and include them in your project. Then, import the necessary classes or packages. For example, using Apache Commons Lang:

```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
```

### Best Practices for Managing Imports

1. **Import Only What You Need:**
   - Import specific classes or packages to keep your code clean and avoid naming conflicts.

2. **Use IDE Features:**
   - Utilize your IDE's features like "Organize Imports" or "Optimize Imports" to manage imports automatically.

3. **Keep Dependencies Updated:**
   - Regularly update external libraries to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.

4. **Understand the Libraries You Use:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the documentation of the libraries you include to use them effectively.

### IDE Assistance

Most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse offer features to help manage imports, such as automatic suggestions, organizing imports, and removing unused ones.
