### Overview of Java Interfaces

In this explanation, we'll discuss the concept of **interfaces** in Java, which are an important part of object-oriented programming. The content comes from a tutorial video on interfaces in Java, and the structure follows the flow of how to create, implement, and utilize interfaces in different classes.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **What is an Interface?**
- **Definition**: An interface is like a **template** or **contract** that defines methods a class must implement. It specifies what a class must do without defining how to do it. 
- **Difference from Inheritance**: While classes can only inherit from **one superclass**, they can **implement multiple interfaces**.

#### 2. **Creating Interfaces**
- **Example**: Let's say we have different animals in our program: `Rabbit`, `Hawk`, and `Fish`.
- To model their behaviors, we can create two interfaces: `Prey` and `Predator`.

```java
public interface Prey {
    void flee();
}

public interface Predator {
    void hunt();
}
```
- **Notice**: The methods in interfaces have no body. When a class implements an interface, it must define how the methods work.

#### 3. **Implementing Interfaces**
- A class **implements** an interface by defining the methods declared within the interface.

```java
public class Rabbit implements Prey {
    @Override
    public void flee() {
        System.out.println("The rabbit is fleeing.");
    }
}

public class Hawk implements Predator {
    @Override
    public void hunt() {
        System.out.println("The hawk is hunting.");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Rabbit` implements `Prey` and provides the behavior for `flee()`.
- `Hawk` implements `Predator` and provides the behavior for `hunt()`.

#### 4. **Multiple Interfaces**
- A class can implement **multiple interfaces**, which allows it to inherit behaviors from several sources.
- For example, `Fish` can be both a `Prey` and a `Predator`.

```java
public class Fish implements Prey, Predator {
    @Override
    public void flee() {
        System.out.println("The fish is fleeing from a larger fish.");
    }

    @Override
    public void hunt() {
        System.out.println("The fish is hunting smaller fish.");
    }
}
```

#### 5. **Testing Classes and Methods**
To create and test these classes:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rabbit rabbit = new Rabbit();
        rabbit.flee();  // Outputs: The rabbit is fleeing.

        Hawk hawk = new Hawk();
        hawk.hunt();    // Outputs: The hawk is hunting.

        Fish fish = new Fish();
        fish.flee();    // Outputs: The fish is fleeing from a larger fish.
        fish.hunt();    // Outputs: The fish is hunting smaller fish.
    }
}
```

---

### Summary

- **Interfaces**: Templates that define what methods a class must implement.
- **Method Implementation**: Classes implementing an interface must provide concrete definitions of the methods declared in the interface.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Unlike inheritance, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to share behaviors from different templates.

### Example Code
```java
// Interface definitions
public interface Prey {
    void flee();
}

public interface Predator {
    void hunt();
}

// Rabbit class implementing Prey interface
public class Rabbit implements Prey {
    @Override
    public void flee() {
        System.out.println("The rabbit is fleeing.");
    }
}

// Hawk class implementing Predator interface
public class Hawk implements Predator {
    @Override
    public void hunt() {
        System.out.println("The hawk is hunting.");
    }
}

// Fish class implementing both Prey and Predator interfaces
public class Fish implements Prey, Predator {
    @Override
    public void flee() {
        System.out.println("The fish is fleeing from a larger fish.");
    }

    @Override
    public void hunt() {
        System.out.println("The fish is hunting smaller fish.");
    }
}

// Main method to test
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rabbit rabbit = new Rabbit();
        rabbit.flee();

        Hawk hawk = new Hawk();
        hawk.hunt();

        Fish fish = new Fish();
        fish.flee();
        fish.hunt();
    }
}
```

Interfaces provide flexibility and are a powerful tool for designing software that can be extended and maintained more easily. You can implement multiple interfaces to define different aspects of behavior and share those behaviors across unrelated classes.
