It looks like you're sharing a video or tutorial script explaining the **`abstract` keyword in Java**. I'll summarize and break down the key concepts:

### **Abstract Keyword in Java**

#### **1. What is the `abstract` keyword?**
- The `abstract` keyword in Java can be applied to both **classes** and **methods**.
- An **abstract class**:
  - **Cannot be instantiated** (you cannot create objects of this class directly).
  - Can have **subclasses** (child classes) that extend it.
- An **abstract method**:
  - Is declared without a body (no implementation), meaning it forces subclasses to provide the implementation.

#### **2. Example of Abstract Class**
- **Scenario**: You have a `Vehicle` class and a `Car` class that extends `Vehicle`.
  ```java
  class Vehicle { }
  class Car extends Vehicle { }
  ```

- You can create objects for both:
  ```java
  Car car = new Car();
  Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(); // This is possible but may not make sense
  ```

- However, a **vehicle** on its own is too generic or "abstract"â€”you need a specific type of vehicle (car, truck, etc.). To prevent someone from instantiating the `Vehicle` class directly, you can make it **abstract**:
  ```java
  abstract class Vehicle { }
  ```

- Now, trying to create a `Vehicle` object will give an error:
  ```java
  Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(); // Error: Cannot instantiate the type Vehicle
  ```

#### **3. Abstract Method Example**
- **Abstract methods** are methods declared without a body:
  ```java
  abstract void go(); // This method must be implemented by a subclass
  ```

- An abstract class can contain both regular methods and abstract methods. If a class contains any abstract methods, the class must be declared abstract.

#### **4. Implementing Abstract Methods**
- Subclasses (like `Car`) that extend an abstract class **must implement the abstract methods**.
  
  Example of `Car` implementing the `go` method:
  ```java
  class Car extends Vehicle {
      @Override
      void go() {
          System.out.println("The driver is driving the car");
      }
  }
  ```

- If you try to create a `Car` object and call the `go` method:
  ```java
  Car car = new Car();
  car.go(); // Output: The driver is driving the car
  ```

#### **5. Why Use the Abstract Keyword?**
- **Security & Structure**: It ensures that the more **general classes** (like `Vehicle`) cannot be instantiated directly, requiring the programmer to instantiate a more **specific subclass** (like `Car`, `Truck`, etc.).
- **Forces Method Implementation**: Abstract methods force the child class to provide an implementation, ensuring that essential behaviors (like a vehicle's ability to move) are defined.
