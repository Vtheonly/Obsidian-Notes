### WeakSet:

A `WeakSet` is a collection of objects that are weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to an object stored in a `WeakSet`, that object can be garbage collected.

#### Key Characteristics of WeakSet:

1. **Only Objects**: A `WeakSet` can only contain objects. Attempting to add a non-object value will result in a `TypeError`.
2. **Weak References**: The references to the objects in a `WeakSet` are weak, meaning they do not prevent the objects from being garbage collected if there are no other references to them.
3. **No Iteration**: `WeakSet` does not provide methods for iterating over its elements. This is because the elements can be garbage collected at any time, making iteration unreliable.

#### Example:

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();

const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = { name: "Bob" };

weakSet.add(obj1);
weakSet.add(obj2);

console.log(weakSet.has(obj1)); // true
console.log(weakSet.has(obj2)); // true

// obj1 can be garbage collected if there are no other references to it
```

### Normal Set:

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Unlike `WeakSet`, a `Set` can contain any type of value (not just objects), and the references to the values are strong.

#### Key Characteristics of Set:

1. **Any Value Type**: A `Set` can contain any type of value, including primitives and objects.
2. **Strong References**: The references to the values in a `Set` are strong, meaning they prevent the values from being garbage collected as long as they are in the `Set`.
3. **Iteration**: `Set` provides methods for iterating over its elements, such as `forEach`, `values`, `keys`, and `entries`.

#### Example:

```javascript
const set = new Set();

set.add(1);
set.add("hello");
set.add({ name: "Alice" });

console.log(set.has(1)); // true
console.log(set.has("hello")); // true

set.forEach(value => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Value Types**:
   - `WeakSet`: Can only contain objects.
   - `Set`: Can contain any type of value.

2. **Reference Strength**:
   - `WeakSet`: Weak references, allowing objects to be garbage collected.
   - `Set`: Strong references, preventing values from being garbage collected.

3. **Iteration**:
   - `WeakSet`: No iteration methods.
   - `Set`: Provides iteration methods like `forEach`, `values`, `keys`, and `entries`.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - `WeakSet`: Useful for tracking objects without preventing them from being garbage collected.
   - `Set`: Useful for collections of unique values that need to be iterated over.

### Summary:

- Use `WeakSet` when you need a collection of objects that should not prevent garbage collection.
- Use `Set` when you need a collection of unique values that can be iterated over and should not be garbage collected.

### Weak Sets and Garbage Collection:

#### Weak Sets:

A Weak Set is a collection of objects that are weakly referenced. This means that if the only reference to an object is through a Weak Set, the object can be garbage collected.

#### Weak References:

When we add an object to a Weak Set using `weakSet.add(obj)`, we are not directly creating a weak reference to the object. Instead, the Weak Set stores a weak reference to the object.

The key distinction here is that the `obj` variable still holds a strong reference to the object. The weak reference is created internally by the Weak Set.

#### Example:

```javascript
let obj = { foo: 'bar' }; // Strong reference to the object
const weakSet = new WeakSet();

weakSet.add(obj); // Weak Set creates a weak reference to the object

console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // true

// At this point, there are two references to the object:
// 1. A strong reference from the obj variable
// 2. A weak reference from the Weak Set

obj = null; // Remove the strong reference

// Now, only the weak reference from the Weak Set remains
// The object can be garbage collected

// Note: The exact timing of garbage collection is unpredictable and may vary between JavaScript engines
// However, at some point after the strong reference is removed, the object will be garbage collected

// After garbage collection, the Weak Set will no longer contain the object
// However, there's no way to directly observe when this happens, as it's an internal process

// Attempting to access the object through the Weak Set will return undefined
console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // false (because obj is null)
```

In this example, we create an object `obj` and add it to a Weak Set. We then remove the strong reference to `obj` by setting it to `null`. At this point, the object `{ foo: 'bar' }` has no strong references and can be garbage collected. The Weak Set will no longer contain the object after it's been garbage collected, but there's no direct way to observe when this happens.

Note: The exact timing of garbage collection is unpredictable and may vary between JavaScript engines.

### Weak Set Methods:

A Weak Set has the following methods:

#### 1. `add(value)`:

Adds a new object to the Weak Set.

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = { foo: 'bar' };
weakSet.add(obj);
```

#### 2. `has(value)`:

Returns a boolean indicating whether an object is present in the Weak Set.

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = { foo: 'bar' };
weakSet.add(obj);
console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // true
```

#### 3. `delete(value)`:

Removes an object from the Weak Set.

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = { foo: 'bar' };
weakSet.add(obj);
weakSet.delete(obj);
console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // false
```

Note that Weak Sets do not have the following methods:

* `clear()`: Since Weak Sets are designed for garbage collection, there's no need to manually clear them.
* `size`: Since Weak Sets are designed for garbage collection, the size is not always known, and this property is not available.
* `forEach()`: Since Weak Sets are designed for garbage collection, iterating over the elements is not possible.
* `values()`, `keys()`, `entries()`: These methods are not available on Weak Sets, as they are not designed for iteration.

Weak Sets are primarily used for tracking objects and allowing garbage collection when the objects are no longer needed. They are not designed for general-purpose data storage or iteration.
