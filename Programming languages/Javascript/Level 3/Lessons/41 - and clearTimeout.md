### Description of `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`

In JavaScript, `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` are functions used to manage timed delays in code execution. These functions allow you to execute code after a specified period and cancel a previously set timeout.

### setTimeout

The `setTimeout` function calls a specified function or code snippet after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

#### Syntax:
```javascript
setTimeout(function, delay, param1, param2, ...);
```

- `function`: The function to execute after the delay.
- `delay`: The time, in milliseconds, the timer should wait before executing the function.
- `param1, param2, ...` (optional): Additional parameters to pass to the function.

#### Example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// Correct way to pass arguments to the function
setTimeout(greet, 2000, "Alice");
```

This will execute the `greet` function after 2 seconds, passing "Alice" as an argument to it.

### clearTimeout

The `clearTimeout` function cancels a timeout previously established by calling `setTimeout`.

#### Syntax:
```javascript
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
```

- `timeoutID`: The identifier of the timeout you want to cancel. This ID is returned by the `setTimeout` function.

#### Example:
```javascript
const timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This will not be logged.");
}, 5000);

clearTimeout(timeoutID); // Cancels the timeout
```

In this example, the timeout is set to log a message after 5 seconds, but it is canceled by `clearTimeout` before it can execute.

### Important Note

You cannot directly pass arguments to the function in `setTimeout` by including them in the function call. Instead, you must provide them as additional parameters after the delay argument.

#### Incorrect Usage:
```javascript
setTimeout(greet("Alice"), 2000); // This will immediately call greet("Alice")
```

#### Correct Usage:
```javascript
setTimeout(greet, 2000, "Alice"); // Pass arguments as additional parameters
```

### Summary

- **setTimeout**: Executes a specified function after a specified delay. Additional parameters can be passed to the function.
- **clearTimeout**: Cancels a previously set timeout using the identifier returned by `setTimeout`.

These functions are essential for managing timed code execution and can be used to create delays, timeouts, and asynchronous behaviors in your JavaScript applications.
