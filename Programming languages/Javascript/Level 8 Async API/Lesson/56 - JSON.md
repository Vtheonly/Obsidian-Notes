#### Overview
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Despite its name, JSON is a language-independent format that uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.

#### Structure

JSON is built on two structures:
1. **A collection of name/value pairs.** In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
2. **An ordered list of values.** In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

#### Syntax Rules
- **Data is in name/value pairs:** `"name": "John"`
- **Data is separated by commas:** `"name": "John", "age": 30`
- **Curly braces hold objects:** `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`
- **Square brackets hold arrays:** `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`

#### Example
Here’s an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10021-3100"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    { "type": "home", "number": "212 555-1234" },
    { "type": "fax", "number": "646 555-4567" }
  ],
  "children": [],
  "spouse": null
}
```

#### Data Types
JSON supports the following data types:
- **String**: "Hello, World!"
- **Number**: 123, 12.34
- **Object**: { "key": "value" }
- **Array**: [1, 2, 3]
- **Boolean**: true, false
- **Null**: null

#### Applications
JSON is widely used in web applications to send data between a server and a client. For instance:
- **APIs**: Many web APIs use JSON to exchange data.
- **Configuration files**: JSON is often used for configuration files because it's more readable than XML.
- **Data storage**: Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data in a JSON-like format.

#### Parsing and Stringifying
In JavaScript, you can easily convert JSON strings into JavaScript objects and vice versa using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`:

```javascript
// Parsing JSON string to JavaScript object
let jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
let jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonString);

// Stringifying JavaScript object to JSON string
let newJsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonObj);
```

#### Advantages
- **Readable and easy to understand**: The format is simple and human-readable.
- **Lightweight**: It’s more compact than XML, which reduces the payload size.
- **Language-independent**: Despite being derived from JavaScript, JSON is used across many programming languages.

#### Disadvantages
- **Limited data types**: JSON does not support all the data types available in programming languages, such as date objects or functions.
- **Security**: JSON data can be easily manipulated if not properly secured, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

JSON has become the de facto standard for data interchange on the web due to its simplicity and ease of use. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly suitable for web applications where performance and efficiency are critical.
