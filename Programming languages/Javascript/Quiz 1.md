> [!question] What happens immediately after a block of code associated with a true `if` or `else if` condition is executed?
> a) All following `else if` and `else` blocks in the structure are checked
> b) The program terminates
> c) The rest of the conditions in that specific `if...else if...else` structure are skipped
> d) The same condition is checked again
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) The rest of the conditions in that specific `if...else if...else` structure are skipped

> [!question] In the provided code example (`let grade = 75; ...`), what will be printed to the console?
> a) A
> b) B
> c) C
> d) D
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) C

> [!question] When does the code inside the final `else` block of an `if...else if...else` structure get executed?
> a) Always, regardless of the conditions
> b) Only if the first `if` condition is true
> c) Only if at least one `else if` condition is true
> d) Only if all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions are false
>> [!success]- Answer
>> d) Only if all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions are false

> [!question] What is the key difference mentioned between using `if...else if...else` and using multiple separate `if` statements?
> a) There is no functional difference
> b) `if...else if...else` allows checking multiple conditions sequentially, executing only the first true block
> c) Multiple separate `if` statements are more efficient
> d) Multiple separate `if` statements require an `else` block
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) `if...else if...else` allows checking multiple conditions sequentially, executing only the first true block

> [!question] Using the grade example logic, what would be the output if `grade` was set to 80?
> a) A
> b) B
> c) C
> d) D
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) B

> [!question] In a JavaScript `if...else if...else` structure, if an `else if` condition is true, all subsequent `else if` and `else` blocks within that structure are skipped.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> True

> [!question] Is the final `else` block required when using `if` and `else if` statements?
> a) Yes, it is mandatory for syntax correctness
> b) No, it is optional and can be omitted
> c) Yes, but only if there are more than two `else if` conditions
> d) No, but omitting it will cause a runtime error if no conditions match
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) No, it is optional and can be omitted

> [!question] Based on the provided grade example, what output would result from `let grade = 69;`?
> a) A
> b) B
> c) C
> d) D
>> [!success]- Answer
>> d) D

> [!question] Which keyword must start the entire conditional chain described in the text?
> a) else
> b) else if
> c) if
> d) condition
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) if

> [!question] According to the text, what is the purpose of using `else if` statements?
> a) To execute a block of code only if all previous conditions were false
> b) To check multiple conditions in sequence after an initial `if`
> c) To create a loop that checks conditions repeatedly
> d) To define alternative functions
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) To check multiple conditions in sequence after an initial `if`

> [!question] In JavaScript, what keyword is used to specify a new condition to test if the previous condition(s) were false?
> a) elseif
> b) if else
> c) else if
> d) elif
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) else if
