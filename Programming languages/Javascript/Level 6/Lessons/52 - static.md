### Static Properties and Static Methods

In JavaScript, **static properties** and **static methods** are features of classes that are defined directly on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class. They are useful for defining functionality or data that is shared across all instances of the class, rather than being specific to any one instance.

#### **Static Methods**

Static methods are functions that belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class. They can be called on the class directly, without needing to create an instance of the class.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
class ClassName {
  static staticMethod() {
    // method body
  }
}

// Call the static method
ClassName.staticMethod();
```

**Example**:
```javascript
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  static multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 3));       // Output: 8
console.log(MathUtils.multiply(4, 2));  // Output: 8
```

**Explanation**:
- `MathUtils.add` and `MathUtils.multiply` are static methods.
- They are called directly on the `MathUtils` class, not on an instance of `MathUtils`.

#### **Static Properties**

Static properties are values that belong to the class itself, not to any individual instance. They are useful for storing values that are shared among all instances or for class-wide configuration.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
class ClassName {
  static staticProperty = 'value';
}

// Access the static property
console.log(ClassName.staticProperty);
```

**Example**:
```javascript
class Configuration {
  static baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
  static apiKey = '1234567890abcdef';
}

console.log(Configuration.baseUrl); // Output: https://api.example.com
console.log(Configuration.apiKey);  // Output: 1234567890abcdef
```

**Explanation**:
- `Configuration.baseUrl` and `Configuration.apiKey` are static properties.
- They are accessed directly on the `Configuration` class, not on an instance of `Configuration`.

### Key Points

- **Static Methods**: Belong to the class and can be invoked without creating an instance. Useful for utility functions or operations related to the class as a whole.
- **Static Properties**: Also belong to the class and are shared across all instances. Useful for constants or configuration values that do not change between instances.

### Use Cases

- **Static Methods**: Perform operations that are not dependent on instance data, such as utility functions or calculations.
- **Static Properties**: Hold data that is common to all instances, such as configuration values or default settings.

 a non-static (instance) method can access and modify static properties of a class. Even though static properties belong to the class itself and are not tied to any particular instance, they are still accessible from within instance methods.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Static Properties**: These are shared across all instances of a class and are accessed via the class itself.
2. **Instance Methods**: These operate on individual instances but can also access class-level static properties.

### Example

Let’s illustrate this with a simple example:

```javascript
class Counter {
  // Static property
  static count = 0;

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Instance method that modifies the static property
  incrementCount() {
    Counter.count++;
  }

  // Instance method to get the current count
  getCount() {
    return Counter.count;
  }
}

// Create instances of Counter
const counter1 = new Counter('Counter 1');
const counter2 = new Counter('Counter 2');

// Increment the static count property using instance methods
counter1.incrementCount();
console.log(counter1.getCount()); // Output: 1

counter2.incrementCount();
console.log(counter2.getCount()); // Output: 2

// Access the static property directly through the class
console.log(Counter.count); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Static Property**: `Counter.count` is a static property, so it is shared across all instances of `Counter`.

2. **Instance Method `incrementCount`**:
   - This method accesses and modifies the static property `Counter.count`.
   - It increments the `count` property by 1 each time it is called.

3. **Instance Method `getCount`**:
   - This method retrieves the current value of the static property `Counter.count`.

4. **Behavior**:
   - Both instances (`counter1` and `counter2`) affect the same `count` property.
   - Incrementing the count with one instance affects the count seen by all instances, as they share the same static property.

### Key Points

- **Access**: Non-static methods can access and modify static properties directly by referring to the class name (e.g., `Counter.count`) or by using `this` within the method (e.g., `this.constructor.count`).
- **Shared Data**: Since static properties are shared among all instances, changes made through any instance method will be reflected in all other instances.

This capability is useful when you need to maintain or manipulate class-wide data from within instance methods.
