It looks like you're using a constructor function to create an object with properties, which is a way to achieve object-oriented programming in JavaScript without using the `class` keyword. This is the traditional way of creating objects and simulating classes in JavaScript before the introduction of the `class` syntax in ES6. Here's how it works and how you can achieve your goal purely using functions.

### Constructor Functions

A constructor function is a regular function that initializes an object using the `new` keyword. Here's how it works:

1. **Define a Function**: The function serves as a constructor.
2. **Initialize Properties**: Use `this` to add properties to the object being created.
3. **Instantiate with `new`**: Use the `new` keyword to create an instance of the object.

### Example

Let's look at an example that mirrors your requirements.

```javascript
function IsOdd(number) {
  this.att1 = 5;
  this.att2 = 5;
  this.att3 = 5;
  this.att4 = 5;
}

// Create an instance of IsOdd
let instance = new IsOdd(55);

// Destructure the instance to extract the properties
let { att1, att2, att3, att4 } = instance;

console.log(att1, att2, att3, att4); // Output: 5 5 5 5
```

### Explanation

1. **Constructor Function**:
   ```javascript
   function IsOdd(number) {
     this.att1 = 5;
     this.att2 = 5;
     this.att3 = 5;
     this.att4 = 5;
   }
   ```
   This function initializes properties `att1`, `att2`, `att3`, and `att4` to `5`.

2. **Creating an Instance**:
   ```javascript
   let instance = new IsOdd(55);
   ```
   The `new` keyword creates a new object, and `this` inside the constructor function refers to this new object.

3. **Destructuring Assignment**:
   ```javascript
   let { att1, att2, att3, att4 } = instance;
   ```
   This extracts the properties from the created object into individual variables.

### Simplified Functional Example

You can also achieve similar functionality without using `this` and the `new` keyword, but this won't simulate a class. Instead, it will just return an object directly.

```javascript
function createOddObject() {
  return {
    att1: 5,
    att2: 5,
    att3: 5,
    att4: 5
  };
}

// Create an object
let { att1, att2, att3, att4 } = createOddObject();

console.log(att1, att2, att3, att4); // Output: 5 5 5 5
```

In this example, `createOddObject` is a regular function that returns an object with the desired properties. The properties are then extracted using destructuring assignment.

Both approaches allow you to create objects and manage their properties without using the `class` keyword, adhering to a more functional programming style.

In JavaScript, methods within a class can be defined either directly in the class body or as properties within the constructor function. Understanding the difference between these two approaches is important for designing clean and efficient classes.

### Method Defined Inside the Constructor

When a method is defined as a property within the constructor function, it creates a new function instance for each object created from the class. Here’s your example with the method defined inside the constructor:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(id, username, salary) {
    // Properties
    this.i = id;
    this.u = username || "Unknown";
    this.s = salary < 6000 ? salary + 500 : salary;

    // Method defined inside the constructor
    this.msg = function () {
      return `Hello ${this.u}. Your Salary Is ${this.s}`;
    };
  }
}

const user1 = new User(1, "Alice", 5500);
console.log(user1.msg()); // Output: Hello Alice. Your Salary Is 6000
```

### Methods Defined Outside the Constructor

When a method is defined outside the constructor, it becomes a prototype method. This means all instances of the class share the same method definition, which can be more memory-efficient and allows for inheritance. Here’s how you can define the method outside the constructor:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(id, username, salary) {
    // Properties
    this.i = id;
    this.u = username || "Unknown";
    this.s = salary < 6000 ? salary + 500 : salary;
  }

  // Method defined outside the constructor
  msg() {
    return `Hello ${this.u}. Your Salary Is ${this.s}`;
  }
}

const user1 = new User(1, "Alice", 5500);
console.log(user1.msg()); // Output: Hello Alice. Your Salary Is 6000
```

### Key Differences

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - **Inside Constructor**: Each instance of the class has its own copy of the method, which can lead to increased memory usage if many instances are created.
   - **Outside Constructor**: All instances share the same method definition, which can be more memory-efficient.

2. **Performance**:
   - **Inside Constructor**: Re-creates the method for each instance, potentially leading to slightly slower performance if many instances are created.
   - **Outside Constructor**: Methods are created once and shared among all instances, leading to potentially better performance.

3. **Inheritance and Overriding**:
   - **Inside Constructor**: Methods cannot be inherited or overridden in the same way. Each instance has its own copy of the method.
   - **Outside Constructor**: Methods can be inherited and overridden by subclasses, making it easier to create a hierarchy of classes with shared behaviors.

4. **Code Organization**:
   - **Inside Constructor**: Methods are defined alongside property initialization, which can make the constructor more complex and harder to read.
   - **Outside Constructor**: Methods are separated from property initialization, making the class easier to read and maintain.

### Conclusion

- **Use methods defined outside the constructor** if you want shared behavior among all instances and better memory efficiency.
- **Use methods defined inside the constructor** if you have specific cases where each instance needs a unique function or if you need to include dynamic behavior in the method definition.

In most cases, defining methods outside the constructor is the preferred approach in JavaScript for better code organization and performance.
