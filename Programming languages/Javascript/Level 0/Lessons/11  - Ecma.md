You're correct, but let me clarify and expand on your point:

ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is not an organization, but a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA International. JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of ECMAScript.

The feature you're demonstrating is called string interpolation or template literals, which was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). This feature does indeed make JavaScript syntax more similar to other modern programming languages, improving developer experience and readability.

Here's the corrected comparison:

JavaScript (using template literals):
```javascript
let jake = 'jo';
console.log(`hello ${jake}`);
```

Python (using f-strings):
```python
jake = 'jo'
print(f'hello {jake}')
```

It's worth noting that while ECMAScript aims to standardize and improve JavaScript, many programming languages independently develop similar features. The goal is often to make code more readable and easier to write, rather than to make languages identical.

Other languages with similar string interpolation features include:

- Ruby: `"hello #{jake}"`
- Swift: `"hello \(jake)"`
- Kotlin: `"hello ${jake}"`

This convergence on similar syntax for common operations does indeed make it easier for developers to switch between languages or learn new ones.
