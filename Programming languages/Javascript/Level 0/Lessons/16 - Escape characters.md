You can do this with backslash `\`:

```javascript
console.log('jake\
            and\
            fin');
```

`\` is an escape character.

Notes:
- The backslash (`\`) is indeed used as an escape character in JavaScript.
- In this context, it's used for line continuation, allowing a single string to span multiple lines in the code without breaking.
- The spaces after each `\` will be ignored in the output.
- The resulting string will be "jakeandFin" (without line breaks).
