You're absolutely right. Inside the curly braces of a template literal, you can include various types of expressions and operations. Let's explore some examples:

```javascript
let price = 0;
let discount = 20;
let isAvailable = true;

console.log(`The Price Is ${price || 200}`);
console.log(`Discounted Price: ${(price || 200) - discount}`);
console.log(`Status: ${isAvailable ? 'In Stock' : 'Out of Stock'}`);
console.log(`Price with Tax: ${(price || 200) * 1.1}`);
console.log(`Availability: ${isAvailable && 'Available Now'}`);
console.log(`Nullish Price: ${price ?? 'Not Set'}`);
```

Explanations:

1. `${price || 200}`: Logical OR for default value.
2. `${(price || 200) - discount}`: Arithmetic operation.
3. `${isAvailable ? 'In Stock' : 'Out of Stock'}`: Ternary operator.
4. `${(price || 200) * 1.1}`: More complex arithmetic.
5. `${isAvailable && 'Available Now'}`: Logical AND for conditional rendering.
6. `${price ?? 'Not Set'}`: Nullish coalescing operator.

You can also include function calls, object property access, and more complex expressions:

```javascript
let product = { name: 'Widget', getPrice: () => 150 };

console.log(`Product: ${product.name}, Price: ${product.getPrice()}`);
console.log(`Uppercase Name: ${product.name.toUpperCase()}`);
```

These examples demonstrate that you can use various JavaScript expressions, operators, and even function calls within the `${}` in template literals. This flexibility makes template literals very powerful for string formatting and dynamic content generation.
