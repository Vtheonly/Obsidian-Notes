### Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript related to the scope of variables declared with `let` and `const`. It refers to the period between the start of a block and the actual declaration of the variable within that block. During this period, the variable is in a "dead zone" and cannot be accessed, resulting in a `ReferenceError` if you try to use it. The TDZ ensures that variables are not accessed before they are properly initialized, which helps catch errors early in the code execution.

Example of TDZ:

```javascript
{
    console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
}
```

### Implicitly Declared Global Variables

When you assign a value to a variable without declaring it using `let`, `const`, or `var`, the variable is created as a global variable. This means it becomes a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). Implicitly creating global variables can lead to unintended side effects, such as accidental overwriting of existing global variables and making debugging more challenging. This practice is generally discouraged because it can introduce bugs and reduce code maintainability.

Example of an implicitly declared global variable:

```javascript
function createGlobalVariable() {
    x = 20; // Implicitly creates a global variable
    console.log(x); // 20
}

createGlobalVariable();

console.log(x); // 20 (x is accessible globally)
```

In this example, the variable `x` is implicitly declared inside the function `createGlobalVariable` and becomes a global variable. This means `x` can be accessed outside the function, potentially causing conflicts with other parts of the code that may use the same variable name.

### Summary

- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: Refers to the period between entering a block and the variable's declaration where the variable cannot be accessed. Attempting to access it during this period results in a `ReferenceError`.

- **Implicitly Declared Global Variables**: Occur when a variable is assigned a value without being declared with `let`, `const`, or `var`, leading to the creation of a global variable. This can introduce bugs and is generally discouraged due to the risk of unintended side effects and naming conflicts.
