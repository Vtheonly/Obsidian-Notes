In JavaScript, the `${}` syntax is part of a feature called template literals, also known as template strings. Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside string literals. This is particularly useful when working with strings that span multiple lines or when you want to include variables or expressions within a string.

Here's a basic example of using template literals:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
```

In the example above, the `${}` syntax is used to embed variables (`name` and `age`) within the string.

Regarding your question about HTML code, you can easily include HTML code inside template literals. Here's an example:

```javascript
const heading = "Welcome to My Website";
const content = "<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>";

const webpage = `
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>${heading}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>${heading}</h1>
      <div>${content}</div>
    </body>
  </html>
`;

console.log(webpage);
```

In this example, the variables `heading` and `content` are included within the HTML structure using the `${}` syntax. Keep in mind that when you include HTML inside template literals, it's treated as a string, so any HTML tags will be treated as plain text unless rendered in the context of a webpage.

If you want to dynamically generate HTML elements and append them to the DOM, you would typically use the DOM manipulation methods rather than including raw HTML strings in your JavaScript code. For example:

```javascript
const headingText = "Welcome to My Website";
const paragraphText = "This is a paragraph of text.";

const heading = document.createElement("h1");
heading.textContent = headingText;

const paragraph = document.createElement("p");
paragraph.textContent = paragraphText;

document.body.appendChild(heading);
document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
```

This approach is safer and more maintainable because it avoids potential security issues associated with injecting raw HTML into the page.
