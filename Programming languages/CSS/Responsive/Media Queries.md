# 🎯 CSS Media Queries – Deep Dive

## ✅ Clarifying the Focus
This note explores **CSS Media Queries**, which allow developers to apply styles based on specific **device conditions** like width, height, orientation, resolution, and more. This is **critical for responsive design** and is often asked in **interviews**.

---

## 🧠 What Are Media Queries?

> **Definition**: Media Queries are a feature of CSS that allows **conditional application of styles** depending on the **characteristics of the user's device or viewport**.

They help in building interfaces that adapt to screen sizes, device capabilities, and environments without changing HTML or using JavaScript.

## 🔧 Syntax Overview

```css
@media media-type and (media-feature) {
  /* CSS rules */
}
````

- **media-type**: e.g., `screen`, `print`, `all`
    
- **media-feature**: e.g., `max-width`, `min-height`, `orientation`, `resolution`
    

### Example

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Media Types

|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`all`|Applies to all media types|
|`screen`|Default for screens (phones, laptops, etc)|
|`print`|Styles for printed documents or previews|
|`speech`|For screen readers / voice synthesis|

---

## 📐 Common Media Features

|Feature|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`width`|Exact viewport width|`width: 1024px`|
|`min-width`|Minimum viewport width|`min-width: 768px`|
|`max-width`|Maximum viewport width|`max-width: 600px`|
|`height`|Viewport height|`height: 800px`|
|`orientation`|Landscape or portrait|`orientation: portrait`|
|`aspect-ratio`|Ratio between width and height|`aspect-ratio: 16/9`|
|`prefers-color-scheme`|Light or dark mode preference|`prefers-color-scheme: dark`|
|`hover`, `pointer`|Touch vs mouse input detection|`hover: none`|

## 🔄 Media Query Examples

### 📱 Mobile-First Design (Recommended)

Start with base styles, then use `min-width` to progressively enhance.

```css
/* Mobile styles (default) */
.card {
  width: 100%;
}

/* Tablet and above */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

/* Desktop and above */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .card {
    width: 33.33%;
  }
}
```

### 🌗 Dark Mode

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #121212;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

### 📄 Print Styles

```css
@media print {
  body {
    font-size: 12pt;
    background: none;
  }
}
```

---

## 🔍 Combining Multiple Conditions

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .layout {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

---

## 🚫 Inverse Media Queries

Use `not`, `only` for finer control:

```css
@media not screen {
  /* This will not apply to screen devices */
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Explicitly targeting only screen devices */
}
```

---

## 🛠️ Debugging and Best Practices

### ✅ Tips

- Always include the `<meta name="viewport" ...>` tag in HTML for mobile responsiveness.
    
- Group related breakpoints near each other in the stylesheet.
    
- Use **logical breakpoints** based on **content flow**, not specific device names.
    
- Use `em`-based breakpoints for scaling with user font settings.
    

### ❌ Common Mistakes

- Using only `max-width` without accounting for `min-width` in mobile-first designs.
    
- Over-specifying queries: fewer, well-placed queries are better.
    
- Forgetting to test on actual devices or emulators.

## 📎 Interview-Focused Questions

### Conceptual

- What are media queries and why are they important?
    
- Difference between `min-width` and `max-width`?
    
- Why prefer mobile-first design?
    
- How can you make a website adapt to dark mode?
    

### Practical

- Build a responsive navbar using media queries.
    
- Adjust font sizes and layout at certain breakpoints.
    
- Create a layout that switches from flex column to row above 600px.

## 🏁 Summary

Media queries are the backbone of responsive CSS. Mastering them enables you to:

- Write adaptive layouts that work on any screen
    
- Optimize performance by targeting specific conditions
    
- Improve accessibility with user preference detection
    

Use them **strategically**, not excessively, and combine with **modern layout tools** like Flexbox and Grid for maximum control.
