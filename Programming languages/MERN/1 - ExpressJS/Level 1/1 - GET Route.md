The `GET` route in Express.js is used to define how your server responds when it receives a **GET request** at a specific URL path. In your code, you’ve defined two `GET` routes—one for the root (`/`) and another for `/hi`. Let me explain the `GET` route in detail.

---

### **What is a `GET` Route?**

- **Purpose**: A `GET` route handles **HTTP GET requests**, which are the most common type of requests used to retrieve data or content from the server.
- **URL Path**: Each `GET` route is associated with a specific URL path (e.g., `/`, `/hi`).
- **Response**: The server sends back a response to the client, which could be plain text, HTML, JSON, or other formats.

---

### **Syntax of `app.get()`**

```javascript
app.get(path, callback);
```

- **`path`**: This is the URL endpoint (route) for the GET request (e.g., `'/'` or `'/hi'`).
- **`callback`**: A function that gets executed whenever a GET request is made to the specified route. The callback has two main parameters:
    1. **`req` (request)**: Represents the incoming request from the client.
    2. **`res` (response)**: Represents the outgoing response from the server.

### **Example in Your Code**

#### **Root Route (`/`)**

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});
```

- **Path**: `'/'` (this is the root route, which is accessed when you go to `http://localhost:3000/`).
- **Callback**:
    - **`req`**: Contains information about the request (e.g., headers, query parameters, etc.), though it’s not used here.
    - **`res`**: Used to send a response back to the client.
        
        ```javascript
        res.send('Hello from Express!');
        ```
        
        This sends a plain text response, `"Hello from Express!"`, which is displayed in the browser.

---

#### **Second Route (`/hi`)**

```javascript
app.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello again');
});
```

- **Path**: `'/hi'` (this route is accessed when you go to `http://localhost:3000/hi`).
- **Callback**:
    - **`req`**: Represents the request object (not used here).
    - **`res.send('Hello again')`**: Sends `"Hello again"` as the response.

---

### **How GET Routes Work**

1. **The Client Makes a Request**:
    
    - When you visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, the browser sends an **HTTP GET request** to the server at the root path (`/`).
    - Similarly, visiting `http://localhost:3000/hi` sends a GET request to the `/hi` path.
2. **The Server Matches the Route**:
    
    - The Express server looks at the URL path and tries to match it with the routes you’ve defined using `app.get`.
3. **Executing the Callback**:
    
    - When a match is found (e.g., `/` or `/hi`), the corresponding callback function is executed.
4. **Sending the Response**:
    
    - Inside the callback, the `res` object is used to send a response to the client.
    - For example, in the `/hi` route:
        
        ```javascript
        res.send('Hello again');
        ```
        
        This sends the string `"Hello again"` back to the client, which the browser displays.

---

### **What Happens If No Route Matches?**

- If a client requests a URL that doesn’t match any of the defined routes, Express will return a default **404 Not Found** response.

For example:

- If you visit `http://localhost:3000/unknown`, it doesn’t match any defined route (`/` or `/hi`), so the server responds with:
    
    ```
    Cannot GET /unknown
    ```
    

---

### **Extending the `GET` Route**

You can enhance the `GET` routes by:

1. **Using Query Parameters**:
    
    ```javascript
    app.get('/greet', (req, res) => {
      const name = req.query.name || 'Guest';
      res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    });
    ```
    
    - URL: `http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Mersel`
    - Response: `"Hello, Mersel!"`
2. **Using Route Parameters**:
    
    ```javascript
    app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.params.id;
      res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
    });
    ```
    
    - URL: `http://localhost:3000/user/42`
    - Response: `"User ID: 42"`

### **Key Takeaways**

- `app.get()` defines how your server handles GET requests for specific paths.
- The `req` object lets you access details about the client request (like query strings or headers).
- The `res` object is used to send a response back to the client.
- GET routes are commonly used for serving pages, retrieving data, or handling simple actions.
