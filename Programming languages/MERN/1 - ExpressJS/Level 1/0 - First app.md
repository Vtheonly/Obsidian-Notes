```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express.js inside Docker!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
### **Code Breakdown**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
```

1. **Importing Express:**
    
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    ```
    
    - `express` is the web framework you are using to build your server.
    - The `require('express')` function imports the Express module, making its functionality available in the code.
2. **Creating an Express Application:**
    
    ```javascript
    const app = express();
    ```
    
    - `app` is an instance of an Express application. It is the core object that you use to define routes, middleware, and handle requests/responses.
3. **Defining the Port:**
    
    ```javascript
    const port = 3000;
    ```
    
    - This specifies the port number (`3000`) where your application will listen for incoming HTTP requests.

---

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express.js inside Docker!');
});
```

4. **Defining a Route:**
    
    - `app.get('/')` defines a **GET request route** for the root path (`/`).
    - It specifies what happens when a client (e.g., a browser or Postman) sends a GET request to the root URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`).
5. **Request (`req`) and Response (`res`):**
    
    - The **`req`** object represents the incoming request, allowing you to access things like query parameters, headers, and body.
    - The **`res`** object represents the response you send back to the client.
6. **Sending a Response:**
    
    ```javascript
    res.send('Hello from Express.js inside Docker!');
    ```
    
    - This sends the string **"Hello from Express.js inside Docker!"** as the HTTP response to the client.

---

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

7. **Starting the Server:**
    - `app.listen(port, callback)` starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port (`3000`).
        
    - The callback function runs when the server starts successfully. In this case, it logs a message to the console:
        
        ```
        App listening at http://localhost:3000
        ```

### **What Happens When You Run This Code:**

1. **The Server Starts:**
    
    - Running this code creates a web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **When You Visit the URL `/`:**
    
    - When a browser or tool (e.g., Postman) sends a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/`, the server processes the request and executes the route defined for `/`.
3. **Response Sent:**
    
    - The server sends the response `"Hello from Express.js inside Docker!"` back to the client, which is displayed in the browser or as a response in your HTTP tool.

---

### **Why "Inside Docker"?**

- If this application is running inside a **Docker container**, it behaves just like a normal server but is isolated inside the container.
- When you map port `3000` of the Docker container to your local machine (via `docker run -p 3000:3000`), you can access the app at `http://localhost:3000` even though it's running inside Docker.
