### What Makes Node.js Node.js?
**Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Itâ€™s built on the **V8 JavaScript engine**, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome. However, Node.js adds a number of features that make it well-suited for server-side development and other non-browser applications.

### Key Features of Node.js:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Node.js operates on a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This means it can handle many operations concurrently, making it highly efficient for I/O-heavy tasks, like handling requests to a web server.

2. **Asynchronous I/O:**
   - Node.js uses asynchronous input/output operations, which allows the system to handle other tasks while waiting for data to be read or written. This is crucial for performance, especially in network applications.

3. **Single-Threaded but Scalable:**
   - Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it processes requests in a single thread. However, it uses an event loop and background workers for heavy tasks, making it capable of handling a large number of connections simultaneously.

4. **NPM (Node Package Manager):**
   - Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that includes a vast repository of libraries and modules, making it easy to add functionality to your applications without having to build everything from scratch.

5. **Server-Side Capabilities:**
   - Unlike traditional JavaScript that runs in the browser and interacts with the DOM, Node.js can interact directly with the file system, databases, network, and more, making it a powerful tool for building web servers, APIs, and other backend services.

### Difference Between Node.js and JavaScript:
1. **Environment:**
   - **JavaScript:** Typically runs in the browser. It interacts with the DOM, handles events like clicks, and manipulates web pages.
   - **Node.js:** Runs on the server or any environment outside the browser. It can interact with the file system, databases, and perform tasks like handling HTTP requests.

2. **Global Objects:**
   - **JavaScript (in the browser):** Has global objects like `window` and `document` for interacting with the web page.
   - **Node.js:** Has global objects like `global`, `process`, `require`, and `module`, which are used to interact with the system environment, manage modules, and more.

3. **Modules:**
   - **JavaScript:** Uses ES6 modules (import/export) in modern browsers. Earlier, script tags or libraries like RequireJS were used for module management.
   - **Node.js:** Uses the CommonJS module system by default (`require` and `module.exports`). It also supports ES6 modules but with some configuration.

4. **APIs:**
   - **JavaScript:** Includes browser-specific APIs like the DOM API, Fetch API, and Web Storage API.
   - **Node.js:** Provides APIs for server-related tasks like working with the file system (`fs`), handling HTTP requests (`http`), reading environment variables, and more.

5. **Use Cases:**
   - **JavaScript:** Primarily used for front-end development to create interactive web pages.
   - **Node.js:** Used for back-end development, building web servers, APIs, real-time applications (like chat apps), and other server-side tasks.

### Summary:
- **JavaScript** is a programming language that can run in any environment that supports it, usually within a browser.
- **Node.js** is an environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server-side or outside the browser, with additional features and APIs suited for building network applications, web servers, and more.
