# Using React with CDNs

Yes, you can absolutely use React without a build step like `create-react-app` by including it directly via CDN links in your HTML file. This is often done for:
*   Simple demos or small projects.
*   Integrating React into an existing non-React website for a specific component.
*   Learning React fundamentals without worrying about build tools.

## How it Works

You typically need two main scripts:
1.  **React (`react.development.js` or `react.production.min.js`):** This is the core React library that defines components, state, props, etc.
2.  **React DOM (`react-dom.development.js` or `react-dom.production.min.js`):** This library provides DOM-specific methods, allowing React to interact with the browser's DOM (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`). The "DOM React" you mentioned is this library.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>React CDN Example</title>
    <!-- React library -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <!-- React DOM library -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <!-- Babel (to transpile JSX in the browser - optional, but common for CDN use) -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel"> // Note the type="text/babel"
        function MyApp() {
            return <h1>Hello from React via CDN!</h1>;
        }

        const container = document.getElementById('root');
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
        root.render(<MyApp />);
    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Key Points:

*   **JSX:** If you want to use JSX (the HTML-like syntax), you'll also need to include a browser-based transpiler like Babel Standalone (as shown in the example). You then put your React code in `<script type="text/babel">` tags. Without Babel, you'd have to write React components using `React.createElement()`, which is more verbose.
*   **No Build Step:** You skip `npm install`, `webpack`, `parcel`, etc. This is simpler for small things but lacks optimizations (like tree-shaking, code splitting) and features (like CSS Modules, hot reloading) that build tools provide for larger applications.
*   **Performance:** For production, always use the `.production.min.js` versions of the libraries as they are smaller and optimized. Transpiling JSX in the browser with Babel also adds a performance overhead, so it's generally not recommended for large production applications.
*   **Creating the App:** You "create the app" by writing your React components and then using `ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode).render(<YourAppComponent />)` to mount it to a DOM element in your HTML. You don't need `create-react-app`'s `npx create-react-app my-app` command.
