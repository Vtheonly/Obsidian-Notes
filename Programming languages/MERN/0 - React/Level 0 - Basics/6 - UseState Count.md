In React, the state is a special variable that determines how the component behaves and what it renders. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect those changes. Let's break down your question and explain why the `count` variable updates in the HTML when you click the button.

### Understanding the Code

Here's the snippet of your code:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
  count is {count}
</button>
```

### Explanation

1. **State Management**:
   - You likely have a state variable `count` and a state setter function `setCount` defined in your component using the `useState` hook.
   - The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update that state (`setCount`).

   ```jsx
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   ```

2. **Event Listener**:
   - The `onClick` attribute in the `button` element sets up an event listener. When the button is clicked, the function passed to `onClick` gets executed.
   - In this case, the function is an arrow function that calls `setCount` with an updater function: `(count) => count + 1`.

3. **State Update**:
   - The updater function `(count) => count + 1` receives the current state (`count`) and returns a new state (`count + 1`).
   - `setCount` updates the state with this new value.

4. **Re-render**:
   - When the state changes, React triggers a re-render of the component.
   - During this re-render, the new value of `count` is used.
   - The text inside the `button` element, `count is {count}`, gets updated because the `count` variable has a new value.

### Why the Count Changes

- **State Dependency**: The displayed text `count is {count}` is dependent on the state variable `count`.
- **Reactivity**: React's reactivity ensures that whenever the state changes, the component re-renders with the updated state.
- **Event Handling**: The `onClick` event listener properly triggers the state update.

### Simplified Example

Here's a complete example to illustrate this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>
        count is {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:
- The `useState` hook initializes `count` to `0`.
- Clicking the button increments `count` by `1`.
- React re-renders the `Counter` component, and the updated value of `count` is displayed inside the button.

### Summary

The count updates and reflects in the HTML because:
- React state management (`useState`) is used.
- An event listener (`onClick`) updates the state.
- React's reactivity ensures the component re-renders with the new state, updating the displayed value.
