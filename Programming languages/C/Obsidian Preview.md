# Copy-Pasting from GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Other LLMs
You can easily copy-paste content generated by GPT, Claude, Gemini, or other language models directly into Obsidian. This includes text, lists, code, diagrams, and even LaTeX for mathematical expressions. Below are examples of different elements that you can use in your Obsidian notes.

## LaTeX in Markdown
You can include LaTeX equations directly in Markdown for mathematical notation, like this:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} \left( \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7}{x^2 + 1} \right) dx + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n^2} + \lim_{x \to \infty} \left( \frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x + 6} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{6} + \ln(2) + \sqrt{\frac{e^{\pi} - 1}{e^{\pi} + 1}}
$$

## Diagrams with Mermaid
You can also add diagrams using Mermaid syntax:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

## Code Blocks
You can insert code snippets for various programming languages, making it easy to document your projects:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
