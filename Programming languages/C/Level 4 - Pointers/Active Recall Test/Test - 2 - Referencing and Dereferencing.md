Here's a 12-question quiz based on the concepts of reference and dereference in C, with four options for each question:

---

### C Pointers Quiz

#### Question 1:
What does the `&` operator in C do?
- [ ] A. It dereferences a pointer.
- [ ] B. It provides the memory address of a variable.
- [ ] C. It increments the value of a variable.
- [ ] D. It swaps the values of two variables.

#### Question 2:
What does the `*` operator in C do when used with a pointer?
- [ ] A. It gives the size of the pointer.
- [ ] B. It multiplies two values.
- [ ] C. It accesses the value stored at the pointer’s address.
- [ ] D. It swaps the values of two variables.

#### Question 3:
What is stored in the pointer variable `xptr` after the following line?
```c
int *xptr = &x;
```
- [ ] A. The value of `x`.
- [ ] B. The address of `x`.
- [ ] C. The value stored at `xptr`.
- [ ] D. The value of the pointer `xptr`.

#### Question 4:
What happens when you dereference a pointer using the `*` operator?
- [ ] A. You get the address of the pointer itself.
- [ ] B. You modify the pointer.
- [ ] C. You access or modify the value stored at the pointer’s address.
- [ ] D. The pointer is incremented by 1.

#### Question 5:
What is the output of the following code?
```c
int x = 10;
int *xptr = &x;
printf("%d", *xptr);
```
- [ ] A. The address of `x`.
- [ ] B. 10.
- [ ] C. The address of `xptr`.
- [ ] D. Undefined behavior.

#### Question 6:
Which of the following correctly assigns the value of `y` to `*yptr`?
- [ ] A. `int *yptr = &y;`
- [ ] B. `int *yptr = y;`
- [ ] C. `int yptr = &y;`
- [ ] D. `*yptr = y;`

#### Question 7:
What is the problem with the following code?
```c
int* ptr = badPointer();
printf("%d", *ptr);
```
- [ ] A. `ptr` does not store the correct address.
- [ ] B. `badPointer()` returns a local variable that goes out of scope.
- [ ] C. `*ptr` gives the address of the variable.
- [ ] D. This code works fine.

#### Question 8:
What will happen if a pointer is dereferenced after the variable it points to goes out of scope?
- [ ] A. The program will always crash.
- [ ] B. The pointer will point to valid memory.
- [ ] C. Dereferencing will give a garbage value or undefined behavior.
- [ ] D. It will print 0.

#### Question 9:
Which of the following is true about passing a pointer to a function?
- [ ] A. It passes the value of the pointer variable.
- [ ] B. It passes the memory address of the pointer itself.
- [ ] C. It allows modification of the original value stored in the variable the pointer is pointing to.
- [ ] D. It passes the pointer by reference.

#### Question 10:
What is the output of the following code?
```c
int x = 10;
int *xptr = &x;
*xptr = 20;
printf("%d", x);
```
- [ ] A. 10
- [ ] B. The address of `xptr`
- [ ] C. 20
- [ ] D. Undefined behavior

#### Question 11:
What does the following code do?
```c
int b = 5;
int *a = &b;
*a = 10;
```
- [ ] A. It sets `a` to 10.
- [ ] B. It sets `b` to 10.
- [ ] C. It sets both `a` and `b` to 10.
- [ ] D. It creates a memory leak.

#### Question 12:
Which of the following is the correct way to declare a pointer to an integer?
- [ ] A. `int ptr;`
- [ ] B. `int *ptr;`
- [ ] C. `int ptr*;`
- [ ] D. `int &ptr;`
