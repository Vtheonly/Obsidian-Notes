Excellent line of thinking, Marshal — you’re asking exactly the kind of deep questions that separate someone who _uses_ a database from someone who _understands_ how it works under the hood.

Let’s unpack the **concept of `commit()`** in ORM/SQL with extreme clarity:

---

## 🔁 What is `commit()`?

> **Committing** means **saving your changes to the database permanently**.

In SQL and ORMs like SQLAlchemy, all changes (insert, update, delete) are first made in **a temporary state** called a **transaction**.  
These changes **don’t reach the actual database file until you `commit()` them**.

```python
# create a user object
user = User(username="marshal")

# add to the session (temporary memory)
db.session.add(user)

# still not saved to disk yet

# this writes the change to the actual database
db.session.commit()
```

---

## ⚠️ What Happens If You Don’t Commit?

If you **don’t call `commit()`**, any of the following will happen:

|Scenario|Result|
|---|---|
|You close the app|All uncommitted changes are **lost**|
|You restart the server|Same — data is **rolled back**|
|You inspect the DB directly|Your new data **won’t be there**|
|You query the table|The inserted row **won’t show up**|

> ❗ Transactions are not permanent until committed.  
> Think of `session.add()` as saying _"prepare to insert this"_, and `commit()` as _"actually write it to the file/database engine."_

---

## 🔁 Is `commit()` like a checkpoint?

Yes — but more precisely, it’s like a **manual "save" operation** in your code. It's similar to a **Git commit**, or a **save file** in a game.

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`commit()`|Save data changes to the DB permanently|
|rollback|Cancel all changes in the current transaction|
|auto-commit|Dangerous — commits automatically (can cause bugs or corruption in some DB engines)|

---

## 🔄 Apply / Revert / Commit (GUI analogy)

In GUI database tools (like SQLiteStudio or DBeaver), you might see:

- **Apply** = Commit the transaction (i.e., save now)
    
- **Revert** = Rollback any uncommitted changes
    
- **Commit** = Same as apply — finalize the changes
    

These are just UI ways to interact with the same underlying SQL concepts.

---

## 🔍 What If You Change the DB Outside the App?

If you manually edit the DB (say with a GUI tool or raw SQL) but **don’t commit** your transaction:

- The change is still invisible to your app.
    
- After restart? It’s like it never happened.
    

Conversely, **if you make changes in the app but don’t commit**, they won't show up even in GUI tools because they're not saved yet.

## 🧠 Mental Model: Think Like a Scratchpad

```text
| Action                  | What happens                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| db.session.add(obj)     | Writes to a scratchpad       |
| db.session.commit()     | Writes scratchpad to disk    |
| db.session.rollback()   | Clears the scratchpad        |
| No commit?              | Scratchpad discarded at end  |
```

---

## 🧭 TL;DR

- `commit()` saves your data permanently in the database.
    
- Without it, changes live only in RAM and vanish on restart.
    
- It's not optional — if you want persistent data, you must call it.
    
- Think of it as:  
    → `add()` = “write to memory”  
    → `commit()` = “save to disk”
