Thank you for the clarification and the excellent example! I understand now. You want keywords or tags that are directly relevant to the *content* of each chapter, not just a summary of the chapter's purpose.

Here are the keywords for Chapter 1, refined to be more content-specific and formatted as tags:

---

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Design Fundamentals

*   **Tags:** #systems-design-interview #coding-interview #problem-solving #data-structures #foundational-knowledge #design-fundamentals #system-scalability #system-robustness #system-functionality #design-process #interview-preparation #technical-interviews

**Key Points:**

*   **Distinction: Coding vs. Systems Design Interviews:**
    *   **Coding Interviews:** Focus on algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and basic coding proficiency. Candidates are tested on their ability to write functional code to solve specific problems.
    *   **Systems Design Interviews:** Focus on architectural design, trade-offs, and understanding how to build large-scale, reliable, and performant systems. Requires a much broader knowledge base beyond just coding.
*   **Core Role of Design Fundamentals:**
    *   These are the essential building blocks for designing complex systems.
    *   They are the "what you need to know" to even begin answering systems design questions, analogous to how data structures are fundamental for coding interviews.
    *   Without them, attempting a systems design problem is largely impossible.
*   **Nature of Systems Design Questions:**
    *   Often presented as broad, high-level requirements (e.g., "Design Twitter Feed," "Design a URL Shortener").
    *   The candidate's role is to drive the discussion, ask clarifying questions, and explore different design aspects.
*   **Importance of Justification and Trade-offs:**
    *   The interview is less about a single "correct" answer and more about the candidate's thought process, ability to articulate design decisions, and understanding of trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. cost, consistency vs. availability).

**Prompt for Clarity:**

Does this revised set of tags and points better capture the specific content discussed in Chapter 1? Are you ready to move on to Chapter 2, which will delve into the specific categories of design fundamentals?
