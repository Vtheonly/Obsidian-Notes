Loops are a core feature of programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. This is essential for iterating over arrays, processing lists of data, or performing any action a specific number of times. PHP provides several types of loops, each suited for different scenarios.

## `1. The for Loop`

The `for` loop is ideal when you know exactly **how many times** you want the loop to run. It's the classic, counter-based loop.

### **Anatomy of a `for` loop:**
It is defined by three expressions separated by semicolons, all inside parentheses: `for (initialization; condition; increment)`.

1.  **Initialization (`$i = 0;`)**: This runs *once* at the very beginning of the loop. It's used to create a counter variable (traditionally named `$i` for *index*).
2.  **Condition (`$i < 5;`)**: This is checked *before each iteration*. If the condition is `true`, the code block runs. If it becomes `false`, the loop stops.
3.  **Increment (`$i++`)**: This runs *at the end of each iteration*. It's used to update the counter, moving it closer to the exit condition.

#### **Basic Example:**
```php
<?php
  // This loop will run 5 times (for $i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
  for($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo 'The value of i is ' . $i . '<br>';
  }
?>
```

#### **Looping through an Indexed Array with `for`:**
You can use a `for` loop to iterate through an indexed array by using the counter `$i` to access each element's index.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['shaun', 'ryu', 'yoshi'];

  // Use count($ninjas) to make the loop dynamic
  for($i = 0; $i < count($ninjas); $i++) {
    echo $ninjas[$i] . '<br>';
  }
?>
```
**Advantage**: Gives you access to the index (`$i`), which can be useful.
**Disadvantage**: More verbose than `foreach` and not suitable for associative arrays.

## `2. The foreach Loop`

The `foreach` loop is the modern and preferred way to iterate over **arrays**. It's cleaner, easier to read, and works perfectly with both indexed and associative arrays. It automatically handles getting each element without needing a counter.

### **Anatomy of a `foreach` loop:**
`foreach ($array as $variable)`

*   `$array`: The array you want to loop through.
*   `$variable`: A temporary variable that will hold the *value* of the current element in each iteration.

#### **Looping through an Indexed Array with `foreach`:**
```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['shaun', 'ryu', 'yoshi'];

  foreach($ninjas as $ninja) {
    echo $ninja . '<br>';
  }
?>
```

#### **Looping through an Associative Array (or Multi-dimensional):**
This is where `foreach` truly shines.

```php
<?php
  $products = [
    ['name' => 'shiny star', 'price' => 20],
    ['name' => 'green shell', 'price' => 10],
    ['name' => 'red shell', 'price' => 15]
  ];

  foreach($products as $product) {
    // In each iteration, $product is one of the inner associative arrays.
    echo 'Product: ' . htmlspecialchars($product['name']);
    echo ' - Price: $' . htmlspecialchars($product['price']);
    echo '<br>';
  }
?>
```

## `3. The while Loop`

The `while` loop is the simplest type of loop. It will continue to execute a block of code **as long as a condition remains true**. It's useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to loop.

### **Anatomy of a `while` loop:**
`while (condition) { ... }`

The condition is checked *before each iteration*.

**Crucial Point:** You must ensure that something inside the `while` loop eventually causes the condition to become `false`. Otherwise, you will create an **infinite loop**, which will crash your script. This usually involves manually incrementing a counter.

#### **Basic Example (mimicking a `for` loop):**
```php
<?php
  $i = 0; // 1. Initialize counter OUTSIDE the loop

  while($i < 5) { // 2. Set the condition
    echo 'The value of i is ' . $i . '<br>';
    $i++; // 3. Manually increment INSIDE the loop
  }
?>
```

#### **Looping through an Array with `while`:**
This is possible but is considered clunky and is rarely used in practice. A `for` or `foreach` loop is almost always better for arrays.

```php
<?php
  $products = [
    ['name' => 'shiny star', 'price' => 20],
    ['name' => 'green shell', 'price' => 10],
    ['name' => 'red shell', 'price' => 15]
  ];
  
  $i = 0;
  while($i < count($products)) {
    echo 'Product: ' . htmlspecialchars($products[$i]['name']) . '<br>';
    $i++;
  }
?>
```

## `Practical Example: Generating an HTML List`

Combining loops with HTML is a primary use case in PHP. Here's how you can generate an unordered list (`<ul>`) from an array of products using the superior `foreach` loop.

```php
<?php
  $products = [
    ['name' => 'shiny star', 'price' => 20],
    ['name' => 'green shell', 'price' => 10],
    ['name' => 'red shell', 'price' => 15],
    ['name' => 'gold coin', 'price' => 5],
    ['name' => 'lightning bolt', 'price' => 40],
    ['name' => 'banana skin', 'price' => 2]
  ];
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PHP Tutorials</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Products</h1>
  <ul>
    <?php foreach($products as $product) { ?>
      
      <h3><?php echo htmlspecialchars($product['name']); ?></h3>
      <p>â‚¬ <?php echo htmlspecialchars($product['price']); ?></p>

    <?php } ?>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```
This example elegantly mixes HTML and PHP. The loop iterates through each product, and for each one, it creates an `<h3>` and `<p>` tag containing that product's details.
