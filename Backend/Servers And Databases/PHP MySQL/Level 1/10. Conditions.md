Conditional statements are the decision-making building blocks of a program. They allow you to execute certain blocks of code only if a specific condition is met (evaluates to `true`). This lets your application respond dynamically to different data and inputs.

The core structure in PHP is the `if`, `elseif`, `else` chain.

---

### `1. The Basic if-elseif-else Structure`

This structure allows you to test a series of conditions in order.

*   `if`: The first condition to be checked.
*   `elseif`: If the `if` condition was `false`, you can check another condition with `elseif`. You can have multiple `elseif` statements.
*   `else`: This is the fallback block. It runs only if *all* preceding `if` and `elseif` conditions were `false`.

**How it executes:** PHP checks the conditions from top to bottom. As soon as it finds a condition that is `true`, it executes that block of code and then **exits the entire `if/elseif/else` chain**.

#### **Example from your screenshot:**
```php
<?php
  $price = 20;

  if ($price < 10) {
    echo 'the condition is met';
  } elseif ($price < 30) {
    // This block will be executed
    echo 'elseif condition met';
  } else {
    echo 'condition not met';
  }
?>
```
**Execution Walkthrough:**
1.  `if ($price < 10)`: Is `20 < 10`? This is `false`. PHP skips this block.
2.  `elseif ($price < 30)`: Is `20 < 30`? This is `true`. PHP executes this block, printing "elseif condition met".
3.  Because a condition was met, PHP now skips the final `else` block and continues with the code after the chain.

### `2. Combining Conditions: Logical Operators`

Often, you need to check more than one thing at a time within a single `if` statement. This is where logical operators come in.

| Operator | Name | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `&&` | **AND** | Both conditions on either side must be `true`. |
| `||` | **OR** | At least one of the conditions must be `true`. |
| `!` | **NOT** | Inverts a boolean value (e.g., `!true` becomes `false`). |

#### **Example with a `foreach` loop:**
Let's use the `$products` array from your tutorial to find items within a specific price range.

```php
<?php
  $products = [
    ['name' => 'shiny star', 'price' => 20],
    ['name' => 'green shell', 'price' => 10],
    ['name' => 'red shell', 'price' => 15],
    ['name' => 'gold coin', 'price' => 5],
  ];

  foreach($products as $product) {
    // Let's find products that cost MORE than 2 AND LESS than 15
    if($product['price'] < 15 && $product['price'] > 2){
      echo htmlspecialchars($product['name']) . '<br />'; // Outputs: green shell, gold coin
    }

    // Let's find products that are very cheap OR very expensive
    if($product['price'] < 10 || $product['price'] > 18){
      echo htmlspecialchars($product['name']) . '<br />'; // Outputs: shiny star, gold coin
    }
  }

  // NOTE: The example `if($product['price'] > 20 && $product['price'] < 10)`
  // from your screenshot can NEVER be true. A number cannot be both greater
  // than 20 AND less than 10 at the same time. This is a good example
  // of why checking your logic is so important!
?>
```

### `3. Alternative Syntax for Templating (Mixing HTML & PHP)`

When you need to use conditional statements inside an HTML file, repeatedly using `<?php ... ?>` for `{` and `}` can get very messy and hard to read. PHP provides a cleaner, alternative syntax for this exact situation.

*   Replace the opening brace `{` with a colon `:`.
*   Replace the closing brace `}` with `endif;`, `endforeach;`, `endwhile;`, etc.

**The "Messy" Way (from your screenshot):**
```php
<ul>
  <?php foreach($products as $product){ ?>
    <?php if($product['price'] > 15){ ?>
      <li><?php echo htmlspecialchars($product['name']); ?></li>
    <?php } ?>
  <?php } ?>
</ul>
```

**The "Clean" Way (Recommended):**
This is much easier for designers and developers to read and understand.

```php
<ul>
  <?php foreach($products as $product): ?>
    
    <?php if($product['price'] > 15): ?>
      <li><?php echo htmlspecialchars($product['name']); ?></li>
    <?php endif; ?>

  <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```
This version clearly shows where the `if` and `foreach` blocks start and end within the HTML structure, without a confusing jumble of curly braces.
