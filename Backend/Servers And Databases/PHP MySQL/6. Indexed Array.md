#Tags: #PHP #Fundamentals #Arrays #DataStructures #IndexedArrays #Brackets #Index

An **array** is a special type of variable that can hold more than one value at a time, organized as a list. An **Indexed Array** is the most common type of array, where each value is identified by a numeric position called an *index*.

This is how you manage collections of related data, like a list of users, product names, or daily temperatures.

> **Crucial Concept**: In PHP (and most programming languages), array indexes **start at 0**, not 1. The first item is at index `0`, the second is at index `1`, and so on.

## `Creating Indexed Arrays`

There are two common ways to create an indexed array in PHP. The modern short syntax (`[]`) is preferred.

### `1. Short Array Syntax (Modern, Recommended)`
This method uses square brackets `[]` and is the standard in modern PHP code. It's clean and easy to read.

```php
<?php
  // Creating an array of strings
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];
  
  // Creating an array of numbers
  $scores = [20, 30, 15, 45, 50];
?>
```

### `2. The array() Construct (Older)`
This is the original way to create arrays. You will see it often in older PHP projects or tutorials. It functions identically to the short syntax.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = array('Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario');
  $scores = array(20, 30, 15, 45, 50);
?>
```

## `Accessing Elements with an Index [Brackets]`

This is the core of your question. To get a single value out of the array, you use its name followed by the desired index inside square brackets `[]`.

Let's use our `$ninjas` array for these examples:
`$ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];`

Visually, the array looks like this:

| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Value** | 'Shaun'| 'Yoshi'| 'Mario'|

#### **Code Examples:**

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];

  // Access the FIRST element (index 0)
  echo $ninjas[0]; // Output: Shaun
  
  echo '<br>';

  // Access the THIRD element (index 2)
  echo $ninjas[2]; // Output: Mario

  echo '<br>';

  // You can also use arrays in concatenated strings
  echo 'The winner is ' . $ninjas[1] . '!'; // Output: The winner is Yoshi!

  // What happens if you access an index that doesn't exist?
  // echo $ninjas[3]; // This will produce a "Notice: Undefined offset: 3"
?>
```
As you can see, trying to access an invalid index will generate a #Notice, which connects back to our lesson on error types. The script will continue, but it's a sign that your code has a bug.

## `Modifying and Adding Elements`

You can also use the bracket syntax to change existing values or add new ones.

### `Modifying an Existing Element`
To change a value, simply assign a new value to it at its specific index.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];
  
  // Let's replace 'Mario' with 'Luigi'
  $ninjas[2] = 'Luigi';
  
  // Now the array is ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Luigi']
  echo $ninjas[2]; // Output: Luigi
?>
```

### `Adding a New Element`
To add a new element to the *end* of an array, use empty square brackets `[]`. PHP will automatically find the next available numeric index.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];
  
  // Add 'Peach' to the end of the array
  $ninjas[] = 'Peach';
  
  // The array is now ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario', 'Peach']
  // 'Peach' was added at index 3
  echo $ninjas[3]; // Output: Peach
?>
```

## `Useful Functions for Arrays`

Here are two essential functions when working with arrays.

### `1. count()` - Getting the Size of an Array
The `count()` function returns the total number of elements in an array.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario', 'Peach'];
  $totalNinjas = count($ninjas);

  echo "There are " . $totalNinjas . " ninjas."; // Output: There are 4 ninjas.
?>
```

### `2. print_r()` - Viewing the Whole Array for Debugging
You **cannot** use `echo` to display an entire array; it will only show the word "Array". To inspect the full contents of an array for debugging, use `print_r()`. It's common to wrap it in `<pre>` HTML tags to make the output readable.

```php
<?php
  $ninjas = ['Shaun', 'Yoshi', 'Mario'];
  $ninjas[1] = 'Browser';
  $ninjas[] = 'Toad';
  
  echo '<pre>';
    print_r($ninjas);
  echo '</pre>';

  /*
  The output in the browser will be:
  
  Array
  (
      [0] => Shaun
      [1] => Browser
      [2] => Mario
      [3] => Toad
  )
  */
?>
```
