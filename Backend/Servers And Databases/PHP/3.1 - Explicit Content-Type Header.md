Below is an example that illustrates what happens when you explicitly set the header versus when you don’t.

## Example with Explicit Content-Type Header

Imagine you have this PHP script:

```php
<?php
// Set the content type to HTML
header('Content-Type: text/html');

// Get the path to the index.html file
$htmlFile = __DIR__ . '/../frontend/html/index.html';

// Check if the file exists
if (file_exists($htmlFile)) {
    // Read and output the contents of the HTML file
    readfile($htmlFile);
} else {
    // If file doesn't exist, show an error
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "Error: HTML file not found";
}
?>
```

### Expected Output When the HTML File Exists:

- **HTTP Response Header:**  
    `Content-Type: text/html`
- **Browser Behavior:**  
    The browser receives the header telling it to treat the content as HTML, so it renders the HTML file correctly.
- **Displayed Page:**  
    The content of `index.html` is displayed, formatted as a web page.

### Expected Output When the HTML File Does Not Exist:

- **HTTP Response Header:**  
    `Content-Type: text/html` (set by the header)
- **HTTP Status Code:**  
    404 (set via `http_response_code(404)`)
- **Browser Behavior:**  
    The browser renders the text "Error: HTML file not found" as plain HTML.
- **Displayed Page:**  
    A simple error message:  
    **Error: HTML file not found**

## Example Without Explicit Content-Type Header

Now, if you remove the header line:

```php
<?php
// (Header line omitted)

// Get the path to the index.html file
$htmlFile = __DIR__ . '/../frontend/html/index.html';

if (file_exists($htmlFile)) {
    readfile($htmlFile);
} else {
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "Error: HTML file not found";
}
?>
```

### Likely Outcome When the HTML File Exists:

- **HTTP Response Header:**  
    The server (or PHP configuration) may automatically send:  
    `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`  
    if that’s the default.
- **Browser Behavior:**  
    The HTML file is rendered as before, because the default is typically HTML.
- **Displayed Page:**  
    The same content of `index.html` appears.

### Potential Outcome in a Different Environment:

- **HTTP Response Header:**  
    If the default MIME type were not set to HTML, the browser might receive something like:  
    `Content-Type: text/plain`
- **Browser Behavior:**  
    The browser would display the HTML file’s code as plain text rather than rendering it as a webpage.
- **Displayed Page:**  
    You would see the raw HTML source code instead of the formatted page.

## Summary

- **With the header:**  
    You ensure that the browser interprets the output as HTML.
- **Without the header:**  
    It usually works because PHP defaults to HTML, but there's a risk—especially in custom or less common setups—that the content might be treated as plain text or another type.

By explicitly setting `Content-Type: text/html`, you make your intentions clear and your code more robust across different environments.
