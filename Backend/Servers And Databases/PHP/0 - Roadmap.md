    Understand if/else statements, loops (`for`, `foreach`, `while`, `do-while`), and switch-case.
- **Functions:**  
    How to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values.
- **Working with Forms & User Input:**  
    Handling GET/POST requests, form validation, and sanitization.
- **Error Handling:**  
    Basic error reporting, using `try/catch` blocks for exceptions.
- **File Handling:**  
    Reading from and writing to files.

**Intermediate:**

- **Sessions & Cookies:**  
    Managing user sessions, setting, and retrieving cookies.
- **Working with Arrays & Built-in Functions:**  
    Array manipulation functions, sorting, and filtering arrays.
- **Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
    Classes, objects, properties, methods, and simple inheritance.
- **Basic Security Practices:**  
    Preventing SQL injection, XSS, and understanding data sanitization.
- **Introduction to Composer:**  
    Using PHPâ€™s dependency manager for handling libraries.

**Advanced:**

- **Advanced OOP:**  
    Concepts like interfaces, abstract classes, traits, and design patterns (e.g., MVC).
- **Namespaces & Autoloading:**  
    Organizing code and managing dependencies effectively.
- **Frameworks & Modern Practices:**  
    Exploring frameworks such as Laravel or Symfony, and understanding RESTful API development.
- **Testing & Debugging:**  
    Unit testing with PHPUnit, debugging techniques, and profiling code performance.
- **Advanced Security:**  
    Deep dive into secure coding practices, encryption, and safe session management.

### **MySQL**

**Basics:**

- **Installation & Setup:**  
    How to install MySQL and set up a basic database.
- **CRUD Operations:**  
    Creating (`INSERT`), reading (`SELECT`), updating (`UPDATE`), and deleting (`DELETE`) data.
- **Basic Data Types & Schemas:**  
    Understanding different data types and designing a simple schema.
- **Simple Queries:**  
    Writing basic queries with filtering (`WHERE`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), and limiting results.
- **Basic Joins:**  
    Understanding `INNER JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.

**Intermediate:**

- **Advanced Joins & Subqueries:**  
    Using `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN` (conceptually), and subqueries.
- **Indexing:**  
    How indexes work, and how to use them to improve query performance.
- **Aggregate Functions & Grouping:**  
    Using `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.
- **Transactions:**  
    Understanding transaction control (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and ACID properties.
- **Basic Stored Procedures & Triggers:**  
    Writing simple stored procedures and triggers to automate tasks.

**Advanced:**

- **Query Optimization & Performance Tuning:**  
    Analyzing query performance, using `EXPLAIN`, and optimizing indexes.
- **Complex Stored Procedures & Functions:**  
    Advanced procedural programming within MySQL.
- **Replication & Backup Strategies:**  
    Setting up replication for scalability and understanding backup/restore procedures.
- **Security & User Management:**  
    Managing user privileges, roles, and securing your database.
- **Partitioning & Advanced Indexing:**  
    Techniques for handling very large tables and complex queries.

### **SQL (General Concepts)**

**Basics:**

- **SQL Fundamentals:**  
    Understand Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating and altering tables.
- **Basic Data Manipulation Language (DML):**  
    Inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data.
- **Filtering & Sorting:**  
    Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and basic conditions.
- **Simple Joins & Relationships:**  
    Combining data across tables with `JOIN`.

**Intermediate:**

- **Subqueries & Nested Queries:**  
    How to write queries within queries to solve complex problems.
- **Set Operations:**  
    Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` (if supported).
- **Grouping & Aggregation:**  
    Mastering `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions for summaries.
- **Views:**  
    Creating and managing views for abstraction and simplification.

**Advanced:**

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Window Functions:**  
    Writing recursive queries and performing advanced data analysis.
- **Query Optimization Techniques:**  
    Understanding execution plans, indexing strategies, and rewriting queries for efficiency.
- **Database Normalization & Denormalization:**  
    Designing efficient database schemas.
- **Advanced Transactions & Concurrency Control:**  
    Handling complex transactional logic, locks, and isolation levels.
- **Security Best Practices:**  
    Advanced techniques for securing SQL queries and preventing injection attacks.

### **Tips for Learning:**

- **Practice Regularly:**  
    Build small projects to apply what you learn.
- **Work on Real Projects:**  
    Integrate PHP with MySQL to build dynamic web applications.
- **Read Documentation:**  
    Regularly consult the [PHP Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/) and [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) for best practices and new features.
- **Explore Community Resources:**  
    Engage with communities on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and relevant forums to keep up with evolving best practices.

By following this roadmap, you'll build a strong foundation in both PHP and database management, progressing from essential basics to advanced, professional-level skills.
