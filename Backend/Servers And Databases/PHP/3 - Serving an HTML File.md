Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step explanation of what each part of the PHP code does. You can include this as a note in Obsidian for future reference.

# PHP File Explanation: Serving an HTML File

```php
<?php
// Set the content type to HTML
header('Content-Type: text/html');

// Get the path to the index.html file
$htmlFile = __DIR__ . '/../frontend/html/index.html';

// Check if the file exists
if (file_exists($htmlFile)) {
    // Read and output the contents of the HTML file
    readfile($htmlFile);
} else {
    // If file doesn't exist, show an error
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "Error: HTML file not found";
}
?>
```

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. PHP Opening Tag

```php
<?php
```

- **Purpose:** Indicates the start of PHP code.
- **Note:** Everything between `<?php` and `?>` is processed as PHP.

---

### 2. Set the Content Type Header

```php
// Set the content type to HTML
header('Content-Type: text/html');
```

- **Purpose:** Sends an HTTP header to the client indicating that the content being returned is HTML.
- **Why It Matters:** This informs the browser to interpret the output as HTML, ensuring proper rendering of the page. [[3.1 - Explicit Content-Type Header]]

---

### 3. Define the HTML File Path

```php
// Get the path to the index.html file
$htmlFile = __DIR__ . '/../frontend/html/index.html';
```

- **`__DIR__`:**
    - **Purpose:** A magic constant that returns the directory of the current PHP file.
- **Concatenation:**
    - The code concatenates `__DIR__` with the relative path `/../frontend/html/index.html`.
    - **Explanation:**
        - `..` moves one directory up from the current directory.
        - The rest of the path navigates to the `index.html` file within the `frontend/html` directory.
- **Why It Matters:**
    - This dynamic approach ensures the script can reliably locate the HTML file regardless of the current working directory when the script is run.

---

### 4. Check if the HTML File Exists

```php
// Check if the file exists
if (file_exists($htmlFile)) {
```

- **`file_exists()`:**
    - **Purpose:** Checks whether the specified file exists on the file system.
- **Conditional Statement:**
    - If the file is found, the code inside the `if` block executes.
- **Why It Matters:**
    - Prevents errors by ensuring the file is present before attempting to read it.

---

### 5. Serve the HTML File

```php
    // Read and output the contents of the HTML file
    readfile($htmlFile);
```

- **`readfile()`:**
    - **Purpose:** Reads the file and writes its content directly to the output buffer.
- **Why It Matters:**
    - This is a simple way to serve the contents of the HTML file to the client, effectively displaying the web page.

---

### 6. Handle the Missing File Scenario

```php
} else {
    // If file doesn't exist, show an error
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "Error: HTML file not found";
}
```

- **`else` Block:**
    - **Purpose:** Executes if the HTML file does not exist.
- **`http_response_code(404)`:**
    - **Purpose:** Sets the HTTP response code to 404, which signals "Not Found."
- **`echo`:**
    - Outputs a simple error message to inform the user that the HTML file was not found.
- **Why It Matters:**
    - Provides a clear error response, helping with debugging and improving user experience by properly signaling the error.

---

### 7. PHP Closing Tag

```php
?>
```

- **Purpose:** Marks the end of the PHP code block.
- **Note:** In pure PHP files, the closing tag is optional and sometimes omitted to prevent accidental whitespace at the end of the file.

## Summary

This script:

- Sets the HTTP header for HTML content.
- Dynamically locates the `index.html` file relative to the current script's directory.
- Checks if the file exists.
- Serves the HTML content if found, or returns a 404 error if not.

You can use this explanation as a reference note in your Obsidian vault to help you understand how to serve static HTML files using PHP.
