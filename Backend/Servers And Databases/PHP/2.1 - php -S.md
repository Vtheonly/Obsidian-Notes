The command `php -s` is used to start a built-in PHP web server. The `-s` option stands for "server". It's a simple way to serve PHP files directly from the command line, typically for development and testing purposes. The number that follows `-s` (e.g., `8000`, `8080`) specifies the port number the server will listen on.

To run this project, you'll likely need to:

1.  **Start the PHP built-in web server:**  Since the previous attempts failed, it's possible there's an issue with how the command is being executed or the current working directory. Try running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```

    This will start the PHP server on port 8000.  You can then access the project in your web browser by going to `http://localhost:8000`.  If port 8000 is already in use, try another port, such as 8080: `php -S localhost:8080`.

2.  **Determine the entry point:**  Look at the file structure provided in the environment details.  The project seems to have an `index.html` file in the `app/pages/0 - landing/` directory.  This is a likely candidate for the main page.  If the PHP server is running, try navigating to `http://localhost:8000/app/pages/0 - landing/index.html` (or the appropriate port if you used a different one).  Other potential entry points might be in the other directories under `app/pages/`.

3.  **Check for database connection:** The project includes `db_connect.php`.  Make sure you have a database server (like MySQL) running and that the database connection details in `db_connect.php` are correctly configured.  If the database connection fails, the project may not function correctly.

4.  **Consider PHP files:** Some of the files have a `.php` extension. These files contain PHP code and will be executed by the PHP server. The HTML files will be served directly.
