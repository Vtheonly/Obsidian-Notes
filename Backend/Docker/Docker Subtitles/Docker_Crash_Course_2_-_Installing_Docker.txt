all right then so now you know a little bit more about what docker is the next step is to install it on your computer and on the docker website you're going to find some installation instructions for different systems mac windows and linux now on mac and windows the way we install docker is by downloading and using a tool called docker desktop and on linux you can download the docker engine directly without docker desktop although i think docker desktop is coming soon to linux as well now if you're on a mac installing docker desktop is really really easy just go ahead and download it right here depending on the different type of mac that you have and you can check out the system requirements right here as well and then to install it it's just a simple drag and drop into your applications folder so ted dead simple now on windows which is what i'm using right now it's a little bit more complicated and i will also say that running dock on windows is not quite as smooth as it is on a mac or on computers which already have a linux distribution installed but you can definitely still learn doc on most modern versions of windows which is what we want to do right so anyway like i said to install docker desktop on windows it's slightly more complicated so we're going to be installing docker using a wsl2 backend now wsl is a windows subsystem for linux which basically allows us to run a full linux environment on windows without a virtual machine and it gives us a way to run docker on our windows machines now you can see here some system requirements for using this wsl2 back end so you need one of these windows versions installed right here and you also need to enable the wsl 2 features on windows as well and we get a link right here to see how to do that but before you click that go ahead and start the download of docker desktop by clicking on this button right here then let's take a look at how we enable wsl on windows all right then so i'm going to run through all of these instructions with you now to install and enable wsl but before we do that you need to make sure that you do have a windows version that is capable of using wsl so to check your windows version then you need to basically go down here and we want to search for winver and then run this command and you can see your version right here and the build and you need to make sure it's this build or higher if you're using windows 10 or you have windows 11 all right so make sure you do that first now there is this command right here that you can use with powershell to basically do everything that you need to install and enable all of the different wsl features however i've had problems with that in the past so what i'm going to do is do things the manual way by clicking on this link right here so let me just zoom in a little bit all right so there's a few different steps here so the first step is to enable the windows subsystem for linux on your computer so we need to open up powershell as an administrator so to do that you just come down here look for powershell and you want to right click and you want to run this as an administrator now when you do that it's going to basically ask for permission to do this press yes and then inside here you just want to type in or rather copy and paste this command right here that's the first thing we need to do okay so i've already done that i'm not going to do it again but do that first of all copy it and then paste it into here and press enter all right so step two check requirements for running wsl2 so to update to wsl2 you must be running windows 10 so these versions are higher right so we've already done this we've tested or rather we've checked our version of windows and the builds so this step we can go ahead and then step three enable virtual machine feature so before installing wsl2 you must enable the virtual machine platform optional feature so again in powershell as an administrator we need to run this command so you copy this one by clicking that open up your powershell right here paste it and run it again and then you need to restart your machine to complete the wsl install and update to wsl2 all right then so once you've restarted once you've done all that and restarted your computer then the next step is to download the linux kernel update package so click on here this link to do that it's going to download it and then once you've downloaded it you just need to run that package so down here step five once you've done that set wsl2 as your defaults version because we have standard wsl and wsl2 as well so we need to make sure wsl2 is our default version which is what docket is going to use so open powershell and run this command down here to do that so copy this and again in powershell over here you just need to paste that in and press enter and that's going to set the default version of wsl for us so that's pretty much all done the next thing we need to do is install a linux distribution that we want for example ubuntu so to do that we open up the microsoft store you can click on that link or you can just search for store right here and press enter and then that's going to open up this microsoft store over here and once this is fully loaded we can choose a version of linux to install so you can search up here for whatever you want i've searched for ubuntu in the past which is what i've installed so select that and you can see this ubuntu package right here and we see these other ubuntu packages this is the one i've got but i'm just going to show you this one so you can see this button right here get so click on whichever ubuntu you want i've chosen this one and then you click on get and that's going to install it for you all right so do that first of all now when it's done that and it's complete this button should change to say something like open i think it is like this so you can click on that button to open up that new linux installation now the first time you do this having just installed it it's going to also install something extra so just wait a couple of minutes for that to happen and then it's going to ask you to create an account so it wants some kind of username or email and a password as well so do that and then that is the linux installation done so then once it's all installed either on windows or on mac you can open up docker desktop and take a look so down here i'm just going to search for docker and then i'm going to open it up and then when it is open it's going to look something like this so eventually this docker desktop app is going to list all of our containers in this tab all of our images in the next tab and then all of the volumes as well now all of that might seem like gobbledygook for now but later on it's gonna all make sense so whenever you're using docker on your computer you need to make sure that it's up and running in the background so on windows it should be down here in the bottom right when you click on this little arrow and docker is the white whale right there and on mac you should be able to see it somewhere in the top right i think up here somewhere so that's docker installed next up we're going to talk about images and containers which are two of the most important concepts that you need to understand when it comes to working with docker
