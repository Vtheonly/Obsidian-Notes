@/Networking Roadmap.md 

This is my Obsidian vault and that is my road-map ,for each topic in it i want you to i want you to make a polished explanation in markdown file , I want you to link and use back links whenever concepts are related and require further explanation.


1. explain further each topic in each markdown file
2. when the topic is too difficult it's okay to make a sub folder and sub markdown file
3. use back links between related subject
4. number the naming in folder and files according which should be learned first which is in the road map
