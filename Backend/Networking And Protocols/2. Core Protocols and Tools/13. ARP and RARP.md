# 13. ARP and RARP

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP is a crucial protocol in the TCP/IP suite that operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It is used to resolve IP addresses (Layer 3) to MAC addresses (Layer 2) within a local network.

### How ARP Works

1.  **ARP Request:** When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same local network and knows the destination's IP address but not its MAC address, it sends an ARP request.
    *   This request is a broadcast message sent to all devices on the local network.
    *   The ARP request packet includes the target IP address and asks, "Who has this IP address? Tell me your MAC address."

2.  **ARP Reply:** The device with the IP address that matches the target IP address in the ARP request responds with an ARP reply.
    *   This reply is a unicast message sent directly back to the requesting device.
    *   The ARP reply packet contains the MAC address of the device that owns the target IP address.

3.  **ARP Cache:** The requesting device stores the IP-to-MAC address mapping in its ARP cache.
    *   This cache is a temporary storage of recently resolved IP-to-MAC address mappings.
    *   Subsequent communication with the same IP address can use the cached MAC address, avoiding the need for another ARP request.

### ARP Use Case Example

Imagine Computer A (IP: 192.168.1.10, MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA) wants to send data to Computer B (IP: 192.168.1.20, MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB) on the same network.

1.  Computer A checks its ARP cache for the MAC address of 192.168.1.20.
2.  If the MAC address is not found in the cache, Computer A sends an ARP request broadcast:
    *   "Who has IP address 192.168.1.20? Tell AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA your MAC address."
3.  Computer B, recognizing its IP address in the ARP request, sends an ARP reply unicast to Computer A:
    *   "192.168.1.20 is at BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB."
4.  Computer A receives the ARP reply and updates its ARP cache with the mapping: 192.168.1.20 -> BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB.
5.  Computer A can now encapsulate its data within Ethernet frames addressed to MAC address BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB to communicate with Computer B.

## RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)

RARP is the inverse of ARP. It was used to allow a device to discover its IP address when it only knew its MAC address. RARP is now considered obsolete and has been largely replaced by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

### How RARP Worked (Obsolete)

1.  **RARP Request:** A device, typically a diskless workstation, would broadcast a RARP request on the local network.
    *   This request contained the device's MAC address and asked, "What is my IP address?"

2.  **RARP Server:** A RARP server on the network would listen for RARP requests.
    *   Upon receiving a request, the RARP server would look up the MAC address in its configuration table to find the corresponding IP address.

3.  **RARP Reply:** The RARP server would send a RARP reply back to the requesting device.
    *   This reply contained the IP address assigned to the MAC address in the request.

### Why RARP is Obsolete

*   **Limited Functionality:** RARP only provided IP addresses and not other crucial network configuration parameters like subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server addresses.
*   **DHCP Superiority:** DHCP provides a more comprehensive and dynamic approach to network configuration, including IP address assignment, subnet masks, gateway addresses, DNS server addresses, and IP address leasing. See [[14. DNS and DHCP]] and [[15. DHCP and DNS]].
*   **Broadcast-Based:** Like ARP, RARP relies on broadcasts, which can be less efficient and potentially cause network congestion in larger networks.

## ARP vs. RARP

| Feature             | ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) | RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Resolve IP to MAC address         | Resolve MAC to IP address (Obsolete)       |
| **Direction**       | IP to MAC                           | MAC to IP                                  |
| **Request Content** | Target IP address                 | Source MAC address                         |
| **Reply Content**   | Target MAC address                | Assigned IP address                        |
| **Usage Today**     | Widely used                       | Obsolete, replaced by DHCP                 |

## Conclusion

ARP is an essential protocol for local network communication, enabling devices to find the MAC addresses associated with IP addresses. RARP, while historically significant, is now obsolete, with DHCP providing a more versatile and efficient solution for network configuration. Understanding ARP is crucial for grasping how devices communicate within a local network and how IP addresses are linked to physical hardware addresses.
