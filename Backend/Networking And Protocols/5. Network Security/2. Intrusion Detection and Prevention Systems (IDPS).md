# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

This section covers Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

*   **Function:** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Network-based IDS (NIDS):** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
    *   **Host-based IDS (HIDS):** Monitors activity on a single host.
*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **Signature-based:** Detects known attacks based on signatures.
    *   **Anomaly-based:** Detects unusual activity that deviates from normal behavior.
    *   **Stateful Protocol Analysis:** Examines network protocols for deviations from expected behavior.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

*   **Function:** Detects and *prevents* intrusions by taking actions like blocking traffic or terminating connections.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Network-based IPS (NIPS):** Monitors network traffic and blocks malicious activity.
    *   **Host-based IPS (HIPS):** Monitors activity on a single host and blocks malicious activity.
*   **Detection and Prevention Methods:** Similar to IDS, but with the added capability to take action to prevent intrusions.

## IDPS Best Practices

*   **Regularly Update Signatures:** Keep signatures up-to-date to detect the latest threats.
*   **Tune for Your Environment:** Adjust settings to minimize false positives and false negatives.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review logs to identify and respond to security incidents.
*   **Combine with Other Security Measures:** Use IDPS in conjunction with firewalls and other security tools.
