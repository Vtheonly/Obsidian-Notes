# Encryption and Cryptography

This section covers Encryption and Cryptography in network security.

## Basic Concepts

*   **Encryption:** The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the decryption key.
*   **Decryption:** The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the decryption key.
*   **Cipher:** An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption.
*   **Key:** A piece of information used by a cipher to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Types of Encryption

*   **Symmetric-key Encryption:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
    *   **Examples:** AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish.
*   **Asymmetric-key Encryption:** Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
    *   **Examples:** RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman.
*   **Hashing:** A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size hash value. Used for integrity checks and password storage.
    *    Examples: SHA-256, SHA-3, bcrypt, scrypt

## Cryptographic Concepts

*   **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is only accessible to authorized parties.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring that data has not been tampered with.
*   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or device.
*   **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring that a user cannot deny having performed an action.

## Cryptography in Networking

*   **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Used to secure communication between a web browser and a web server (HTTPS).
*   **IPsec:** Used to secure communication over IP networks.
*   **SSH:** Used for secure remote login and file transfer.
*   **Digital Certificates:** Used to verify the identity of websites and other entities.
* **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** A system for managing digital certificates.
