# Authentication and Authorization

This section covers Authentication and Authorization in network security.

## Authentication

*   **Definition:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or other entity.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Something you know:** Passwords, PINs.
    *   **Something you have:** Smart cards, security tokens.
    *   **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition).
    *   **Somewhere you are:** Geolocation.
    *   **Something you do:** Keystroke dynamics, signature.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Using two or more authentication factors for increased security.

## Authorization

*   **Definition:** The process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the authenticated identity.
*   **Access Control Models:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access is granted based on roles assigned to users.
    *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Access is granted based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
    *   **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** Access is controlled by a central authority based on security labels.
    *   **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** Resource owners control access to their resources.

## Authentication and Authorization Protocols

*   **Kerberos:** A network authentication protocol that uses tickets to grant access to services.
*   **OAuth 2.0:** An authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user.
*   **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** An authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.
*   **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP):** Used for accessing and managing directory information, often used for authentication and authorization.
*   **RADIUS:** A networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users.
*   **TACACS+:** Another protocol that provides AAA services, similar to RADIUS.

## Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use long, complex passwords.
*   **Password Managers:** Use a password manager to securely store and manage passwords.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary access to resources.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit access controls.
