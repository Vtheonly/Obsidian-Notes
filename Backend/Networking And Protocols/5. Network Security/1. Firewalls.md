# Firewalls

This section covers firewalls in more detail, including types, configurations, and best practices.

## Types of Firewalls

*   **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** Operate at the network layer (Layer 3) and transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. They examine packet headers and filter traffic based on rules defined for source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
*   **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** Keep track of the state of network connections (e.g., TCP sessions) and make filtering decisions based on the context of the traffic.
*   **Proxy Firewalls:** Act as intermediaries between clients and servers. They examine the application-layer data (Layer 7) and can filter traffic based on content.
    *   **Forward Proxy:** Protects clients.
    *   **Reverse Proxy:** Protects servers.
*   **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):** Combine traditional firewall features with advanced capabilities like intrusion prevention, application awareness, and deep packet inspection.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Specifically designed to protect web applications by filtering HTTP traffic. They can protect against common web attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

## Firewall Configurations

*   **Rules:** Firewalls use rules to determine which traffic to allow or block. Rules are typically based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and application-layer data.
*   **Zones:** Firewalls often use zones to segment networks based on security levels (e.g., trusted, untrusted, DMZ).
*   **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** A network segment that sits between the trusted internal network and the untrusted external network (e.g., the Internet). It typically hosts publicly accessible servers.

## Best Practices

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow necessary traffic and block everything else.
*   **Regularly Update Rules:** Keep firewall rules up-to-date to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor firewall logs to detect suspicious activity.
*   **Use Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for firewall administration.
*   **Regularly test:** Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
