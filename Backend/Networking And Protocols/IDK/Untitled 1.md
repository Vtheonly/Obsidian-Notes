Okay, here is a merged note combining the key information from both explanations about what constitutes a WebSocket connection:

### Understanding WebSocket Connections: What Counts?

When working with WebSockets, it's crucial to know what actually establishes a "connection." Here’s a consolidated breakdown:

**1. The Core Requirement: The WebSocket Handshake**

*   A true WebSocket connection is **only established after a successful handshake**.
*   This process starts when a client (e.g., JavaScript in a browser using `new WebSocket()`, a Node.js WebSocket client) sends a standard **HTTP request** to the server, but includes a special `Upgrade: websocket` header.
*   The server, if it supports WebSockets and accepts the request, responds with an **HTTP `101 Switching Protocols`** status.
*   **Only after this successful exchange** is the persistent, bi-directional WebSocket connection considered established. The server typically fires an `on('connection')` event at this point.

**2. What Actions Count as Establishing a Connection? ✅**

*   ✅ **Using a WebSocket Client to Initiate:** Explicitly creating a WebSocket object in client-side code (like `const ws = new WebSocket("ws://your-server-address");`) and successfully completing the handshake described above.
*   ✅ **Successful Handshake Completion:** The moment the client receives the `101` response from the server, confirming the protocol switch.

**3. What Actions DO NOT Count as Establishing a Connection? ❌**

*   ❌ **Typing a `ws://` URL into a Browser Address Bar:** Browsers don't handle raw `ws://` or `wss://` URLs directly like `http://`. Nothing will happen; you need client-side code (JavaScript) to initiate the connection.
*   ❌ **Sending Standard HTTP Requests:** Using `fetch()`, `axios`, `curl` (without specific WebSocket flags), or similar tools to send regular HTTP GET/POST requests to the WebSocket endpoint **will not** establish a WebSocket connection. It lacks the required `Upgrade` header and handshake mechanism.
*   ❌ **Simple Network Pings (ICMP/TCP):** Standard network pings check network reachability but don't perform the WebSocket handshake.
*   ❌ **WebSocket Ping/Pong Frames (Before Connection):** WebSockets have a built-in ping/pong mechanism using special frames to keep an *already established* connection alive or check its health. Sending these before a connection is fully established doesn't create one.

**4. After Connection:**

*   Once established, the connection remains open (persistent).
*   Sending and receiving messages (`ws.send()`, `ws.onmessage`) uses this *existing* connection; it doesn't create new ones.

---

**TL;DR:**

*   A WebSocket connection **requires a specific client** (like JavaScript's `new WebSocket()`) **to perform a successful HTTP handshake** with an `Upgrade` header, resulting in a `101` response from the server.
*   Simply visiting a `ws://` URL in a browser, sending standard HTTP requests (`fetch`, `curl`), or basic network pings **does not** create a WebSocket connection.
