# Network Protocols

See also: [[3. IP Addressing]]

This section provides an overview of common network protocols.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

*   **Function:** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 172.217.160.142).
*   **How it works:** DNS uses a hierarchical and distributed database system. When you enter a domain name in your browser, your computer queries a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.
*   **Key Concepts:** DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.), recursive and iterative queries, caching.

## HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)

*   **Function:** HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is used to transfer web pages and other resources between web servers and clients (e.g., browsers). HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the communication.
*   **How it works:** HTTP uses a client-server model. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource.
*   **Key Concepts:** URLs, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.), headers, cookies.
* **HTTPS:** Uses TLS/SSL to encrypt communication.

## FTP/SFTP (File Transfer Protocol / Secure File Transfer Protocol)

*   **Function:** Used to transfer files between computers on a network. FTP is an older protocol that is not secure. SFTP uses SSH to provide secure file transfer.
*   **How it works:** FTP/SFTP uses a client-server model. The client connects to the server and can upload, download, delete, and manage files.
*   **Key Concepts:** FTP commands (USER, PASS, RETR, STOR, etc.), active and passive modes.

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

*   **Function:** Used to send email messages between mail servers.
*   **How it works:** SMTP uses a client-server model. The sending mail server connects to the receiving mail server and transmits the email message.
*   **Key Concepts:** Email addresses, mail servers (MTA), mail clients (MUA).

## SSH (Secure Shell)

*   **Function:** Provides a secure way to access and manage remote computers over a network.
*   **How it works:** SSH uses encryption to protect the communication between the client and the server.
*   **Key Concepts:** SSH keys, port forwarding, tunneling.

## TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol / User Datagram Protocol)

*   **Function:** These are transport layer protocols that provide different ways to deliver data between applications. TCP is connection-oriented and provides reliable, ordered delivery. UDP is connectionless and provides unreliable, unordered delivery.
*   **TCP:**
    *   Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection before transmitting data.
    *   Reliable: Guarantees delivery of data in the correct order.
    *   Error detection and correction.
    *   Flow control.
    *   Used by applications that require reliable data delivery (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).
*   **UDP:**
    *   Connectionless: Does not establish a connection before transmitting data.
    *   Unreliable: Does not guarantee delivery of data.
    *   No error detection or correction (at the transport layer).
    *   No flow control.
    *   Used by applications that can tolerate some data loss (e.g., DNS, video streaming, online gaming).
