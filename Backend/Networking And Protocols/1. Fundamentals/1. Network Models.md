# Network Models

Network models are conceptual frameworks that describe how networks function. The two most important models are the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.

## OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a seven-layer model that standardizes the communication functions of a computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

1.  **Physical Layer:** Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium.
2.  **Data Link Layer:** Provides error-free transmission of data frames over the physical layer.
3.  **Network Layer:** Controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take.
4.  **Transport Layer:** Provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control.
5.  **Session Layer:** Manages connections between applications.
6.  **Presentation Layer:** Formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems.
7.  **Application Layer:** Provides network services to applications like email, file transfer, and terminal emulation.

## TCP/IP Model

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a four-layer model used in modern networks.

1.  **Network Interface Layer (Link Layer):** This layer corresponds to the OSI Physical and Data Link layers. It defines how data is physically sent through the network.
2.  **Internet Layer:** This layer corresponds to the OSI Network layer. It is responsible for addressing, packaging, and routing messages on the Internet. The main protocol here is IP (Internet Protocol).
3.  **Transport Layer:** This layer corresponds to the OSI Transport layer. It provides communication services directly to the application processes running on hosts. The main protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
4.  **Application Layer:** This layer corresponds to the OSI Session, Presentation, and Application layers. It provides network services to applications. Protocols include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.

## Relationship and Differences

The TCP/IP model is more practical and widely used than the OSI model. The TCP/IP model combines the OSI model's Application, Presentation, and Session layers into a single Application layer, and it combines the Physical and Data Link layers into the Network Interface Layer.
