The number of available public IPv4 addresses is indeed limited (about **4.3 billion** total). However, public IPs are unique across the internet because they are **centrally managed and allocated** by organizations like **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)** and **regional registries (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, etc.)**. Here‚Äôs how uniqueness is maintained despite the limited supply:

### üåç **Why Public IPs Are Unique**

1. **Centralized Allocation**:
    
    - Public IPs are assigned by ISPs, which obtain them from IANA and regional internet registries.
    - Each ISP ensures that no two customers receive the same public IP within their network.
2. **Subnetting and Efficient Use**:
    
    - Large blocks of IPs are broken down into smaller subnets and allocated efficiently.
    - Organizations and ISPs only get what they need to avoid waste.
3. **Dynamic vs. Static Public IPs**:
    
    - Most users don‚Äôt have a fixed public IP. ISPs **dynamically assign** an IP from a pool, recycling addresses when devices disconnect.
    - This allows more efficient use of a limited number of public IPs.

### ‚ö† **IPv4 Shortage and Workarounds**

Despite these measures, the IPv4 address space **is running out**. To deal with this, we use:

1. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
    
    - Home and business networks use **private IPs**, and only the router has a **single public IP** for internet access.
    - This allows thousands of devices to share one public IP.
2. **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)**:
    
    - ISPs now use large-scale NAT to share public IPs among multiple customers.
    - This means multiple households might be behind the same public IP, reducing the number needed.
3. **IPv6 Adoption**:
    
    - IPv6 provides **340 undecillion** unique addresses (an insanely large number).
    - It eliminates the shortage problem by offering enough addresses for every device to have a unique public IP.
    - However, adoption is still ongoing.

### ‚úÖ **Final Takeaway**

Even though there are only **~4.3 billion IPv4 public addresses**, strict allocation, recycling, and NAT make them last longer. However, as the internet grows, the transition to **IPv6** is necessary to provide a truly unlimited supply of unique addresses.
