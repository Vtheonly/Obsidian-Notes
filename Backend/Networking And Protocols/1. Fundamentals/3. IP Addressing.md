# IP Addressing

See also: [[2. OSI and TCP/IP Models]]

IP (Internet Protocol) addressing is a fundamental aspect of networking, enabling devices to communicate with each other across networks. This section covers IPv4, IPv6, subnetting, and CIDR.

## IPv4

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most widely used version of IP. It uses a 32-bit address space, which allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

*   **Format:** IPv4 addresses are represented in dotted-decimal notation, consisting of four octets (8-bit numbers) separated by dots. For example, `192.168.1.1`.
*   **Address Classes:** IPv4 addresses were originally divided into classes (A, B, C, D, and E), but this system has largely been replaced by CIDR.
*   **Private Addresses:** Certain address ranges are reserved for private networks (e.g., `192.168.0.0/16`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`).

## IPv6

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4. It uses a 128-bit address space, providing a vastly larger number of unique addresses.

*   **Format:** IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal notation, consisting of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. Leading zeros in a group can be omitted, and one sequence of consecutive zero groups can be replaced with a double colon (`::`).
*   **Address Types:** IPv6 has different address types, including unicast, multicast, and anycast.
*   **Benefits:** Larger address space, simplified header, built-in security (IPsec), and auto-configuration.

## Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks (subnets). This improves network performance, security, and manageability.

*   **Subnet Mask:** A subnet mask is a 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) value that is used to distinguish the network portion of an IP address from the host portion.
*   **Calculating Subnets:** Subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address to create additional network addresses.

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. It replaces the older classful network addressing system.

*   **CIDR Notation:** CIDR notation uses a slash (/) followed by the number of network bits in the IP address. For example, `192.168.1.0/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are the network address.
*   **Benefits:** More efficient use of IP address space, reduces the size of routing tables.
