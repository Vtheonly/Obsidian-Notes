# Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of nodes (e.g., computers, routers, switches) in a network. This section covers common network topologies, including Star, Mesh, and Hybrid.

## Star Topology

*   **Description:** All nodes are connected to a central device (e.g., a switch or hub).
*   **Advantages:** Easy to manage, single point of failure for a single node, easy to add or remove nodes.
*   **Disadvantages:** Central device is a single point of failure for the entire network.

## Mesh Topology

*   **Description:** Each node is connected to every other node (full mesh) or some other nodes (partial mesh).
*   **Advantages:** High redundancy, fault tolerance.
*   **Disadvantages:** Complex to implement, expensive.

## Hybrid Topology

*   **Description:** A combination of two or more different topologies (e.g., star-mesh, star-bus).
*   **Advantages:** Combines the benefits of different topologies.
*   **Disadvantages:** Can be complex to manage.

## Other Topologies
* **Bus Topology:** All devices connected to a single cable.
* **Ring Topology:** Devices connected in a circular loop.
* **Tree Topology:** Hierarchical structure with a root node and branches.
