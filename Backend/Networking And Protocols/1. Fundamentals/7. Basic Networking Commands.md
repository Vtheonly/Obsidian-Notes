# Basic Networking Commands

This section describes common networking command-line tools.

## ping

*   **Function:** Tests connectivity between two nodes on a network.
*   **How it works:** Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target host and listens for ICMP Echo Reply packets.
*   **Usage:** `ping [hostname or IP address]`

## traceroute/tracert

*   **Function:** Displays the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
*   **How it works:** Sends packets with increasing TTL (Time To Live) values to discover the routers along the path to the destination.
*   **Usage:**
    *   Linux/macOS: `traceroute [hostname or IP address]`
    *   Windows: `tracert [hostname or IP address]`

## nslookup

*   **Function:** Queries DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or for any other specific DNS record.
*   **How it works:** Sends a DNS query to a DNS server.
*   **Usage:** `nslookup [hostname or IP address]`

## ipconfig/ifconfig

*   **Function:** Displays and configures network interface parameters.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Windows (ipconfig):** Displays IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other network configuration information. Can also be used to release and renew DHCP leases (`ipconfig /release`, `ipconfig /renew`).
    *   **Linux/macOS (ifconfig):** Displays and configures network interface parameters. Can be used to assign IP addresses, set subnet masks, and enable/disable interfaces.
*   **Usage:**
    *   Windows: `ipconfig [/all]`
    *   Linux/macOS: `ifconfig`

## netstat

* **Function:** Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
* **How it works:** Retrieves information from the operating system's network stack.
* **Usage:** `netstat [-a] [-n] [-o] [-p protocol] [-r] [-s]` (Options vary depending on the operating system)
