# Wireless Networking

This section covers wireless networking concepts.

## Standards (802.11)

*   **802.11a:** Operates in the 5 GHz band, up to 54 Mbps.
*   **802.11b:** Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, up to 11 Mbps.
*   **802.11g:** Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, up to 54 Mbps.
*   **802.11n:** Operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, up to 600 Mbps.
*   **802.11ac:** Operates in the 5 GHz band, up to 1 Gbps and higher.
*   **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E):** Operates in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, up to 10 Gbps and higher.

## Frequencies

*   **2.4 GHz:** Longer range, more susceptible to interference.
*   **5 GHz:** Shorter range, less susceptible to interference, higher speeds.
*   **6 GHz:** (Wi-Fi 6E) Even shorter range, less congestion, higher speeds.

## Security

*   **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** Legacy security protocol, weak and easily cracked.
*   **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** Improved security over WEP.
*   **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2):** Stronger security, uses AES encryption.
*   **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3):** Latest security protocol, enhanced security features.

## SSID and Channels

*   **SSID (Service Set Identifier):** The name of the wireless network.
*   **Channels:** Wireless networks operate on specific channels within a frequency band. Choosing non-overlapping channels can reduce interference.
