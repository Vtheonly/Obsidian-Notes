# Network Devices

This section describes common network devices.

## Hubs

*   **Function:** Connects multiple devices on a network. Operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
*   **How it works:** Receives a signal on one port and broadcasts it to all other ports.
*   **Limitations:** Creates a single collision domain, inefficient, low security.

## Switches

*   **Function:** Connects multiple devices on a network. Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
*   **How it works:** Learns the MAC addresses of connected devices and forwards traffic only to the intended destination port.
*   **Advantages:** Creates separate collision domains, more efficient than hubs, improved security.

## Routers

*   **Function:** Connects multiple networks together. Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
*   **How it works:** Uses IP addresses to route traffic between networks.
*   **Key Concepts:** Routing tables, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).

## Modems

*   **Function:** Modulates and demodulates signals to transmit data over a communication channel (e.g., telephone line, cable).
*   **How it works:** Converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals for transmission, and vice versa.
*   **Types:** Cable modems, DSL modems, fiber modems.

## Firewalls

*   **Function:** Protects a network from unauthorized access.
*   **How it works:** Filters network traffic based on predefined rules.
*   **Types:** Hardware firewalls, software firewalls.
