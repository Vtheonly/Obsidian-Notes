## Definition
A **netmask** (also known as a subnet mask) is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. The netmask helps determine which portion of the IP address is used for the network and which part is used for the host.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of a netmask is to:
- **Identify the Network**: Determine which part of the IP address identifies the network.
- **Identify the Host**: Determine which part of the IP address identifies the host within the network.
- **Routing**: Help routers and other network devices determine the best path for data packets.

## How It Works
A netmask is typically written in dotted decimal notation, similar to an IP address. For example:
- **255.255.255.0**: This netmask indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network address, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host address.
- **255.255.0.0**: This netmask indicates that the first 16 bits are used for the network address, and the remaining 16 bits are used for the host address.

## Examples
- **IP Address**: 192.168.1.1
- **Netmask**: 255.255.255.0
  - **Network Address**: 192.168.1.0
  - **Host Address**: 1

- **IP Address**: 10.0.0.1
- **Netmask**: 255.0.0.0
  - **Network Address**: 10.0.0.0
  - **Host Address**: 1

## CIDR Notation
Netmasks can also be represented using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. For example:
- **192.168.1.0/24**: This is equivalent to a netmask of 255.255.255.0.
- **10.0.0.0/8**: This is equivalent to a netmask of 255.0.0.0.

## Importance
Understanding netmasks is crucial for network configuration, troubleshooting, and ensuring proper communication between devices on a network.

# Example of Netmask Usage

## IP Address and Netmask
- **IP Address**: 192.168.1.10
- **Netmask**: 255.255.255.0

## Breakdown
1. **IP Address in Binary**:
   - 192.168.1.10
   - 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010

2. **Netmask in Binary**:
   - 255.255.255.0
   - 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

3. **Network Address**:
   - To find the network address, perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the netmask.
   - 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010 (IP Address)
   - & 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (Netmask)
   - = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
   - **Network Address in Decimal**: 192.168.1.0

4. **Host Address**:
   - The host address is the remaining part of the IP address that is not part of the network address.
   - **Host Address in Decimal**: 10

## CIDR Notation
- The above example can also be represented in CIDR notation as:
  - **192.168.1.0/24**
  - This means the first 24 bits are used for the network address, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host address.

## Importance
- **Network Identification**: The netmask helps identify that the IP address 192.168.1.10 belongs to the network 192.168.1.0.
- **Host Identification**: Within this network, the host address is 10.
- **Routing**: Routers use the netmask to determine the best path for data packets. For example, any packet destined for an IP address within the range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 will be routed to the same network.

This example illustrates how a netmask is used to divide an IP address into network and host portions, which is essential for network configuration and routing.
