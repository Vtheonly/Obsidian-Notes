- **Purpose**: These interfaces are crucial in ensuring communication between the microprocessor and peripheral devices, such as keyboards, monitors, and sensors.
- **Communication Protocols**: 
  - **Serial Communication**: Data is transmitted bit by bit, sequentially over a single channel. This is commonly used for long-distance communication or when bandwidth is limited.
  - **Parallel Communication**: Multiple bits of data are transmitted simultaneously across several channels. This is faster for short distances but can become more complex and costly.
