## Introduction
Java provides a mechanism for event handling based on the concept of **"Listeners"**. This mechanism allows developers to intercept and handle events triggered by user interactions or state changes in the application.

## How the Listener Mechanism Works

1. **Principle**:
   - A listener is an object designed to **receive and handle events**.
   - It is associated with an object capable of generating events (e.g., a button or a text field).
   - When the event occurs, it is transmitted to the listener, which processes it.

2. **Steps to Handle an Event**:
   1. Define a listener.
   2. Register the listener on an object capable of triggering an event.
   3. When the event occurs, the listener's method is invoked to handle the event.

## Characteristics of a Listener

- A listener:
  - **Receives and processes events**.
  - Contains at least one method that is called when the expected event occurs.
  - **Must implement an interface** that specifies the event-handling methods.

## Types of Listener Interfaces

Java provides several listener interfaces, each designed for specific types of events. Examples include:

- **ActionListener**: Handles action events (e.g., button clicks).
- **KeyListener**: Handles keyboard events (e.g., key presses).
- **MouseListener**: Handles mouse events (e.g., mouse clicks, movements).
- **TextListener**: Handles text-related events (e.g., text field changes).

Each interface defines one or more methods that must be implemented to handle the respective events.

## Example Workflow

1. Create a listener class that implements the appropriate listener interface (e.g., `ActionListener`).
2. Define the required methods to handle the event.
3. Register the listener on the event source (e.g., a button).
4. When the event occurs, the listener's method is automatically invoked to process the event.

This mechanism provides a flexible and decoupled way to handle events in Java's graphical user interface (GUI) applications.
