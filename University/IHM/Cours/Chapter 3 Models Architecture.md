### 1.1. What is Dialogue?

#### Definition 1
- Dialogue is the set of exchanges between a user and a machine.
- This includes interactions such as using a touch screen, a microphone, a scanner, etc.

#### Definition 2
- Dialogue is the set of interactions produced by a human on a computer.
- An interaction is an action that provokes a perceptible reaction.
- This includes actions such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, touch screen presses, etc.
- This is the most common definition in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).

#### Definition 3
- Dialogue is the use of natural language to work on a computer.
- This restrictive definition applies only to the field of natural language research.
- The goal is to work with a machine through commands given in everyday language, with the computer responding in the same language.
- This can be done in several ways: written, oral, or both.

---

### Dialogue Controller

#### Definition
- The Dialogue Controller is the module (or set of modules) dedicated to managing dialogue.
- This module has two main roles: dialogue analysis and dialogue control.

---

#### a. Dialogue Analysis

- Three types of analysis are distinguished:
  1. **Lexical Analysis**: Manages I/O, display, interaction.
  2. **Syntactic Analysis**: Handles dialogue processing and sequencing.
  3. **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzes concepts manipulable by the application.
  
- Most application models associate each type of analysis with a module, sometimes grouping them into a single module.

---

#### b. Dialogue Control

- Control corresponds to the validity of triggering operations depending on the context (data, previous processes, etc.).
- Dialogue control also means managing the sequencing of operations following user interactions.
- In summary, the dialogue controller verifies the validity of interactions and manages the sequencing of resulting processes.

#### Examples

1. **Button State**:
   - A non-grayed button means it can be activated, while a grayed button means it cannot.
   - The interface is informed of the button's state based on data and previous operations managed by the controller.

2. **Operation Sequencing**:
   - Completing one operation allows for the execution of others, which should be reflected on the screen (e.g., making a menu, button, or input field accessible).
   - It is important for the controller to know the necessary sequences to achieve goals.

### Characteristics of a Dialogue Controller

The development of ICTs has allowed an increasingly diverse audience to manipulate software.

- Previously, it was the audience that adapted to the software, but now, designers must consider all types of users within a single application.
- Managing human-machine dialogue has become a separate task and must respect certain general properties that define a good dialogue controller.
- In addition to the classic criteria of software engineering, such as extensibility and reusability, a dialogue controller must meet the following criteria:

#### Flexibility:
- Due to the diverse skills of the audience, the controller must provide different types of dialogue depending on the user type.
- For example, a beginner will use menus, while an expert will prefer keyboard shortcuts or function keys.

#### Adaptability:
- The dialogue controller must adapt to the level and style of the user.
- Two types of solutions are possible: either multiple styles are directly implemented in the system and the system chooses one based on the user, or there are only style rules and the controller applies them based on the user.

#### Integrity:
- The dialogue controller must protect the system against unauthorized access or modifications.
- This is one of the fundamental properties of a dialogue controller.

#### Recovery:
- Errors made during a dialogue session should be recoverable with relatively little effort.
- Example: The Undo/Redo function found in many GUIs, which allows users to undo actions and cancel subsequent ones.

#### Sharing:
- It should be possible to work simultaneously on multiple tasks of the same application from the same dialogue control structure.
- This is referred to as multi-threaded dialogues.

#### Robustness:
- It represents the ability of the dialogue controller to function in abnormal conditions.
- This includes managing predictable errors such as intention and execution errors, as well as unpredictable errors such as task interruptions.

### Software Architecture

- A software architecture describes symbolically and schematically the various elements of one or more computer systems, their interrelationships, and interactions.
- Fundamental principle: separation between interface and functional core (set of services specific to an application).
- Different models:
  - Fundamental model
  - Seeheim model
  - Model-View-Controller (MVC)
  - Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC)
  - And others.

### Fundamental Architecture

- **Functional Core**:
  - It must provide a minimum of services within the framework of an interface:
    - **Notification**: Ability for an external module to be notified when the state of the semantic core changes (data and processing).
    - **Error Prevention**: Ability to determine if a function call is valid in a certain context (not with exceptions, functions for testing).
    - **Cancellation**: Ability to revert to previous states of the semantic core, avoiding simulation at the interface level (e.g., undoing a database transaction, history).

---

### Seeheim Model

- The Seeheim model is the first model to highlight the dialogue controller by separating an application into three modules.
- Historical Role: Software model allowing the replacement of text interfaces with graphical interfaces without changing the functional core.
- The purpose of this model is to distinguish dialogue management from application semantics.
- It consists of three modules grafted onto the application core. Each of these modules is distinct and has well-defined roles.

#### Presentation:
- Responsible for purely lexical management of the application (i.e., manages I/O, display, interaction).
- Its role is to:
  - Manage the presentation and display of manipulated entities, meeting criteria of ergonomics and usability.
  - Manage physical input/output events, translating information between the format of the external real world and the internal computing world.
  - Therefore, presentation handles the external representation of the application.

#### Application Interface:
- A layer connecting the functions and data of the functional core to the data and actions of the interface.
- Its role is to:
  - Connect the functional core and the dialogue control module by calling application procedures.
  - Convert information from the dialogue controller into manipulable concepts by the application.

#### Dialogue Controller:
- Acts as the mediator between the user and the application, i.e., between the presentation and the application interface.
- Its role is to:
  - Control exchanges at the syntactic level (dialogue processing and sequencing) and manage dialogue dynamics.
  - Coordinate between display (presentation) and processing progress.

- Implementing this model presents difficulties as the roles of the modules are not sufficiently explicit.
- It does not perfectly match object-oriented and event-driven programming models, which advocate for control distribution among manipulated objects.
- Therefore, this model has given rise to several models and "improved" versions (e.g., "Modified Seeheim", "Extended Seeheim").

### Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

- **Agent**: 
  - An entity that acts autonomously to achieve its designated goals.
  - Can communicate with other agents.
  - Endowed with capabilities similar to living beings.
  - An agent can be a process, a server, a robot, a human, etc.

#### Properties of an Agent
- **Reactiveness**:
  - Ability to perceive the environment and respond in real-time to changes.
- **Sociability**:
  - Capacity to interact with other agents or users.
- **Proactivity**:
  - Capacity to take initiative and goal-oriented behavior.
- **Autonomy**:
  - Capacity to act without direct human intervention.

---

#### Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
- A distributed system composed of:
  - A set of distributed agents,
  - Situated in a certain environment,
  - Interacting according to certain organizations.
- MAS allows solving complex problems by exploiting the collective intelligence of its constituent agents.

#### The Agent Model
- The Seeheim model has the major drawback of being a centralized system.
- The multi-agent model is a distributed system based on the principle of stimuli-response, with communications between agents established via events.
- An agent consists of:
  - Receivers that receive events from other agents, possibly accompanied by filters to be sensitive to certain types of events.
  - Emitters that transmit typed events to the system, not to a particular agent.
  - Memories to record detected events and to remember the agent's state.
  - A processor that processes events.

---

- An event is detected and captured by all agents whose active receptors at that moment are capable of intercepting it.
- This event is added to the queue of each agent that detected it.
- When its turn comes, the event processing causes a change in the agent's state, which can then emit new events.
- This operating mode allows working in multi-threaded dialogue by associating each thread with a specific agent, enabling a system supporting parallelism with distributed control rather than centralized control in a single component.

#### Implementation in Object-Oriented Languages
- The characteristics of multi-agent systems allow for good implementation in object-oriented languages.
- Each agent type corresponds to a class, with attributes representing the agents' memories, event processing operations stored as methods, and event communication replaced by message sending.
- The instantiation and inheritance capabilities of object-oriented languages enable dynamically creating agents, thus having an evolutionary system, as well as specializing agents compared to other agents.
- This similarity between object-oriented languages and multi-agent systems arises from the modularity and cooperation properties of object-oriented languages. An object is considered as an autonomous entity, just like an agent. Moreover, message communication (or event communication for agents) allows entities to communicate with each other.
- The concept of an agent has been used in several models, such as MVC and PAC.

### MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

#### Overview
- MVC is the multi-agent model used by Smalltalk (Programming Language).
- The goal of this model is to have a system composed of autonomous triplets capable of communicating with each other.
- It enforces separation between data, processing, and presentation.

#### Components
- **Model**: Represents the data structure to be displayed on the screen, composed of objects.
- **View**: The external representation of the Model. It allows the user to perceive the Model (inputs) and reflects its changes (outputs). A Model can have multiple different views, while a View can be associated with only one Model.
- **Controller**: Regulates interactions between the View and the Model. It manages user actions on the View. When the user manipulates the View, the Controller informs the Model of the interactions made, which then modifies its state and informs the View of the new aspect it should take after this modification.

#### Principles
- The Model corresponds to the application's data (structures and functions).
- The View presents information to the user based on the data from the Model.
- The Controller handles interaction with the user.

#### Workflow
- A client sends a request to the application, which is analyzed by the Controller.
- The Controller asks the appropriate Model to perform processing, then returns the adapted View if the Model has not already done so.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**:
  - Synchronized multiple views.
  - Modular views and controllers.
  - Development of reusable components.
  - Internal and external interface coherence.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complexity of communication between components.

#### Example (Java)
```java
// Model
public class Student {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    // Getters and setters
}

// View
public class StudentView {
    public void printStudentDetails(String studentName, String studentId) {
        System.out.println("Student:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + studentName);
        System.out.println("ID: " + studentId);
    }
}

// Controller
public class StudentController {
    private Student model;
    private StudentView view;
    // Constructor, setters, getters
    public void updateView() {
        view.printStudentDetails(model.getName(), model.getId());
    }
}

// Main
public class MVCStudentModel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student model = retriveStudentFromDatabase();
        StudentView view = new StudentView();
        StudentController controller = new StudentController(model, view);
        controller.updateView();
        controller.setStudentName("Amina");
        controller.updateView();
    }
    private static Student retriveStudentFromDatabase() {
        Student student = new Student();
        student.setName("Amine");
        student.setId("20");
        return student;
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion
- MVC facilitates modular development, enhancing clarity and code reusability.
- Used in various platforms such as Excel, Swing, web applications, etc.
- Provides synchronized multiple views, modular views and controllers, and development of reusable components.
- However, it may introduce complexity in communication between components.


### PAC (Présentation Abstraction Contrôle) Model

#### Overview
- PAC is a multi-agent model where each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality, composed of three components: presentation, abstraction, and control.

#### Components
- **Presentation**: Represents the user's perception of the agent.
  - Corresponds to the external representation of the agent.
  - Defines the perceivable behavior of the agent and interaction with the user.
- **Abstraction**: Represents the concepts and functions of the agent.
  - Defines the semantic functionalities of the agent.
  - Represents the expertise of the agent and manages the data to be represented.
- **Control**: Maintains coherence between Presentation and Abstraction.
  - Establishes a link between these two parts while arbitrating conflicts, synchronizations, refreshes, etc.
  - Acts as a translator since the three components exchange information that may have different formats.
  - Manages the correspondence between Abstraction and Presentation (consistency of representations with internal data, conversion of user actions into operations of the functional core) and handles relationships with other PAC agents in the hierarchy.

#### Object Structure
- A simple interactive PAC object consists of an image defining the behavior visible to the user (Presentation) of the functions it uses (Abstraction) and a module to manage the connection between these two modules (Control).

#### Application Structure
- An application based on the PAC model consists of a set of hierarchically and recursively structured PAC agents.
- PAC agents can be decomposed into a set of PAC agents.
- In the figure, the top object in the hierarchy corresponds to the three main parts of the application, with sub-levels being intermediate objects and leaves being the most elementary directly manipulable objects.
- A parent object inherits Presentations from its children, not vice versa.

#### Example: Air Traffic Control System
- A classic example of a PAC architecture is an air traffic control system.
- A PAC agent takes inputs from a radar system on the location of an incoming 747 and uses the Presentation component to paint a spot on the screen.
- Another agent independently takes information on a departing DC-10 and also paints this spot on the screen.
- Another agent takes meteorological data and paints clouds, while another follows the incoming enemy bomber and paints a red spot. 

#### Conclusion
- PAC provides a structured approach to application design by separating presentation, abstraction, and control components.
- It allows for hierarchical and recursive organization of agents, facilitating complex system design and management.
