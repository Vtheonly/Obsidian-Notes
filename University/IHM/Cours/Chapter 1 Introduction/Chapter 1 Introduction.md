# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

## Definition
**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** refers to the part of software that enables:  
1. **Users to interact with the program**, such as performing tasks or inputting data.  
2. **The program to communicate results** back to the user through an accessible and user-friendly interface.  

HCI is centered around creating effective communication between humans and computers by designing usable interfaces.


The field is interested in:

1. The way **humans interact** with **computers** or with each other using computers, as well as,
2. The way to design systems that are:
    - **Ergonomic**
    - **Efficient**
    - **Easy to use**
    - Or more generally **adapted to their context of use**

**Ways of Human-Computer Communication**

1. **Punched Cards**
   - The earliest computers were fed **input** through **instructions coded** on **punched cards**
   - **Output data** was provided on **printers**
   - Example: **Programmable automata**

2. **WIMP**
   - A **pointing system** like the **mouse** allows using a computer with the **WIMP paradigm**
   - WIMP = **Window Icon Menu Pointer**
   - Relies on **graphical user interfaces** to present **information** to the **user**

3. **Voice Command & Gestures**
   - **Automatic speech** or **gesture recognition** allows sending **information** to a computer
   - **Speech synthesis** allows sending **audio signals** understandable by humans
   - **Data gloves** offer more direct interaction than the mouse

4. **Virtual Reality**
   - **Visors** try to **immerse** the human in a **virtual reality**
   - Or **augment reality**

5. **Touch Tables & Smartphones**
   - **Interactive tables** allow coupling direct **human manipulation** on a surface with **information feedback**

**More Ways:**

1. **Command line** (e.g. Unix, Linux)
2. **Query languages** and **question-answering** (e.g. dialog boxes)
3. **Selection forms**
4. **Natural language** (written, speech)
5. **3D interfaces**, gestural, augmented reality
6. **Direct navigation** (e.g. websites)
7. **Direct manipulation WYSIWYG** ("What You See Is What You Get") - Ben Shneiderman (1983) ,Examples: Word, Paint

## Usability Criteria for HCI
To ensure a high-quality user experience, HCI focuses on these usability factors:

- **Effectiveness:** The product allows users to achieve the intended results.  
- **Efficiency:** The product enables users to achieve results with minimal effort or time.  
- **Satisfaction:** Users experience comfort and a positive subjective evaluation during their interaction.

## Ergonomic Criteria
**Ergonomics** in HCI aims to optimize the design of user interfaces to improve:  
1. Efficiency  
2. Ease of use  
3. Comfort  

Ergonomic design aligns interfaces with the user's needs, skills, and expectations while minimizing errors and fatigue.

### Key Ergonomic Principles
1. **Consistency:** Similar concepts should be applied uniformly across similar situations.  
2. **Conciseness:** Reduce the number of actions required by the user to complete a task, using defaults, shortcuts, etc.  
3. **Feedback:** Every user action should result in immediate and meaningful feedback to help users understand the system’s state.  
4. **Activity Structuring:** Organize applications in a hierarchy of increasing complexity for logical understanding.  
5. **Flexibility:** Allow users to easily customize the interface without compromising consistency.  
6. **Error Management:** Guide users toward solutions in case of errors, minimizing frustration and simplifying problem resolution.

## User-Centered Design (UCD)
The ultimate solution for HCI design is a **user-centered approach**, ensuring that:  
- Interfaces meet user needs effectively.  
- The system remains intuitive and approachable.

## Interfaces and Learning
The interface plays a crucial role in learning by bringing the user’s mental model closer to the conceptual model of the software.

### Learning Approaches via HCI
1. **Action-based learning:** Trial-and-error, guided actions, and online help.  
2. **Theoretical learning:** Comprehensive manuals and structured documentation.  
3. **Learning by analogy:** Using metaphors and relatable examples.

---

### Why Use a Design Methodology?
The goal of HCI design is to ensure usability, adaptability, and user satisfaction by considering:  

#### Cognitive Factors
- **Action-based learning:** Users learn by interacting with the system.  
- **Theoretical learning:** Rigorous and detailed documentation supports learning.  
- **Analogy-based learning:** Relatable metaphors and examples accelerate understanding.

#### Personality Factors
- **Introverts/Extroverts:** Design should accommodate varied exploration methods.  
- **Anxious Users:** Require frequent feedback to reduce uncertainty.  
- **Impulsive Users:** Benefit from concise messaging and robust error recovery mechanisms.
