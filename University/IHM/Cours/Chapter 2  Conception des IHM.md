### Software Engineering Design

#### Various Methods in Software Engineering Design

1. **Waterfall and V-Model**
2. **Spiral Model**
3. **Agile Methods (e.g., Scrum)**

---

### Challenges in Traditional Methods

- **Limited User Involvement**
- **System-Centered Methods**: Focus on functionality at the expense of user needs
- **Late Evaluation**: Leads to the "tunnel effect"

---

### Why Adopt an HCI Design Methodology?

Involving users and regularly evaluating HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) design offers several benefits:

1. **Risk and Maintenance Cost Reduction**
2. **Lower Training Budget and Time**
3. **Increased Application Attractiveness and Productivity**
4. **Reuse and Improvement of Core Components**

---

### Phases of HCI Design Methodology

An HCI design method typically involves three phases:

1. **Analysis**
   - Define user expectations and needs
   - Understand user tasks and context

2. **Development**
   - Create an interface (in various stages of completion)

3. **Evaluation**
   - Measure the usability of the created interface
   - Assess user satisfaction
   - Identify improvement areas for future versions

---

### Characteristics of HCI Design Methodologies

#### Iterative Approach

- **Successive Cycles**: Composed of analysis, development, and evaluation phases
- **Complete Interface Work**: Address the entire interface
- **Repeat Until Satisfaction**: Cycles continue until a satisfactory interface is achieved
- **Adaptability**: New objectives and user feedback are continuously considered

#### Incremental Approach

- **Step-by-Step Development**: Create the interface in parts, focusing on one area at a time
- **Partial Solutions**: Develop intermediate solutions
- **Incorporate Feedback**: New objectives and user feedback are continuously integrated

#### Combined Iterative and Incremental Approach

- Utilize the strengths of both iterative and incremental methodologies for a comprehensive design process

---

### Prototyping in HCI Design

Prototyping involves creating intermediate, incomplete versions of software or websites to test usability with users. It is distinct from wireframing as it simulates functionality with fictional or real data.

#### Horizontal Prototypes

- **Focus on Graphics**: Static mockups that present layout and interface elements like buttons, menus, and input fields
- **Uses**:
  - Confirm interface requirements and product scope
  - Provide a demonstration version for stakeholder feedback
  - Offer initial development estimates in terms of time, cost, and workload

#### Vertical Prototypes

- **Functional Implementation**: Develop some functionalities for typical usage scenarios
- **Uses**:
  - Estimate data volume requirements
  - Dimension data systems, interaction needs, network size, and performance levels
  - Clarify requirement complexities relative to current product functionalities

#### Prototyping Stages

1. **Sketches**
   - General overview of the interface (conceptual idea)
2. **Mockups (Wireframes)**
   - Detailed interface without interactions
3. **Prototypes**
   - Incomplete interface version with interactions

#### Decision Points During Prototyping

- **High-Level Choices**: Functionalities available
- **Intermediate-Level Choices**: Screen sequences
- **Low-Level Choices**: Icon designs

#### Prototyping Tools

- **Paper, Post-Its**
- **Transparencies, Video (e.g., Libre Office Impress)**
- **Mockup Software**:
  - High fidelity with interactions (e.g., Invision, Maqetta)
  - Low fidelity with screen links only (e.g., Mocking Bird, Pencil, Balsamiq)
- **Development Software** (e.g., web frameworks, Netbeans, Visual Studio)

#### Advantages of Prototyping

1. Work on multiple detail sets simultaneously
2. Focus on problematic interface parts
3. Explore design alternatives
4. Ensure system usability
5. Visualize the final system for users


### User-Centered Design Characteristics

#### User and Task Analysis for HCI Design
- **Consider Users from the Beginning**
  - Engage users early in the analysis phase.
- **Challenges in Selecting Representative Users**
  - Ensure diverse user representation.
- **Consider Real Usage Context**
  - Keep the actual usage environment in mind.

**Three Models for Specifying Characteristics**:
1. **User Characteristics**
2. **Task Characteristics**
3. **Interaction Characteristics**

---

### User Model

**Identifying Relevant User Characteristics**

**General Data**:
- **Age, Gender, Disabilities**: Tailor designs to user demographics.
- **Education Level, Cultural Habits**: Consider cultural norms (e.g., date formats, reading directions).
- **Psychological Aspects**: Address user preferences (e.g., visual/auditory, logical/intuitive, analytical/synthetic).

**Application-Related Data**:
- **Domain Competence**: User knowledge related to the application's field.
- **IT and System Competence**: User experience level (novice, expert, professional).
- **Usage Frequency**: Occasional or daily use.

---

### Task Model

**Identifying Task Processes**

1. **Construct the Task Hierarchy**:
   - Develop a structured breakdown of system tasks.
2. **Specify Each Task**:
   - Detail tasks, considering exceptions.
3. **Evaluate with Users**:
   - Validate task decomposition with user feedback.

**Task Composition**:
- **Goal**: Define what needs to be achieved.
- **Procedure**: Outline subtasks connected by composition or temporal relationships.
- **Elementary Task**: Task decomposable only into physical actions or input/output operations.

![Task Model Example](file-YBpzkd4RWbuJxJITQFf58HoW)

---

### Interaction Model

**Establishing an Intuitive and "Natural" Correspondence**:

1. **Conceptual Objects Manipulated**:
   - Example: File.
2. **Presentation and Interactions**:
   - Screen representations of the object (e.g., file open, locked).
   - Operations on the object (e.g., open, modify).
   - Inspired by real-world interactions.

---

### Early Evaluation Characteristics

- **Frequent and Early Evaluation of Sketches, Mockups, Prototypes, and Interfaces**
  - Evaluation typically based on scenarios.
  - A scenario includes:
    - **User**: One or a group.
    - **Context**: Environment and constraints.
    - **Tasks**: To be accomplished by the user.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Success Rate**
- **Number of Errors**
- **Task Execution Time**: (e.g., GOMS, KLM models).
- **Number of Steps to Complete the Scenario**
- **Learning Curve**
- **User Satisfaction**

**Example Scenario**:
- **User**: Unfamiliar with the Grooveshark site.
- **Context**: Standard computer with Firefox.
- **Tasks**: Log in to Grooveshark, search music by title and author, add to playlist, and extend the playlist with similar music.

**User Involvement in Informative or Participatory Relationship**:
- **Observed in Task Resolution**: Analysis.
- **Interviewed about Expectations**: Development.
- **Questioned about Interfaces**: Evaluation.

Sure, here is the structured and translated version of your text:

---

### Designer/User Relations

#### Informative Relations
- The user is integrated into the design team but does not participate in final decisions.

#### Participative Relations
- The user is integrated into the design team as a full design partner and therefore participates in final design decisions.
- There is an obligation to accept compromises to satisfy participants, even if they are wrong.

---

### User Interface
"A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, itâ€™s not that good."

---

### In Summary

1. Iterative, incremental, prototyped, user-centered design method with early evaluation consideration.
2. Strong relationship between the design team and the user.

---

### HCI Design Method

An HCI design method requires collecting information on:
1. Users
2. Their tasks
3. Interface evaluations

---

### Information Gathering Techniques

Information gathering techniques are used during the HCI design method to collect information on:

- **Users**
- **Tasks**
  - Sequence of actions
  - Professional vocabulary
- **Interfaces, particularly in evaluation**
  - Ideas
  - Strengths/weaknesses

This version should be clear and well-organized for an English-speaking audience.

Certainly! Here is the structured and translated version of your text:

---

### Focus Group

#### Objective
Understand user motivations.

#### Protocol
- Define different themes to be addressed (5 or 6 recommended).
- Limit the group to 7-10 participants (to manage shyness and speaking time).
- Film the session, use boards and/or assistants.

#### Procedure
1. **Ice-breaker activity**: Users get to know each other (10 min max).
2. **Review rules**: Remind participants of the rules to be followed (10 min max).
3. **Exercises**: Increasingly difficult exercises focusing on more specific aspects of the system (90 min max).
4. **Summary and discussion**: Synthesize results and discuss (10 min max).

#### Outcome
- Comprehensive view of the system in terms of motivations, preferences, priorities, expectations, and potential conflicts.
- Emergence of new ideas through group dynamics.

---

### Brainstorming Procedure

1. **Generate a large number of solutions**:
   - Record all ideas without evaluating them (e.g., on post-its).
2. **Sort ideas based on quality**:
   - Ideas are ranked by the number of votes.
   - Do not overlook unconventional ideas.

---

### Storyboard

#### Objective
Create a realistic description of system usage.

#### Procedure
1. **Identify existing tasks**: Both typical and unusual.
2. **Create work scenarios by generalizing stories**:
   - Mix events from different sources.
   - Incorporate unusual situations into typical activities.
   - Include both successful and unsuccessful scenarios.

---

### Parallel Design

#### Objective
Create multiple interfaces and select their best features.

#### Protocol
- Representative panel of users and/or designers (individually or in groups).

#### Procedure
1. **Independent creation**: Each user (or group) independently creates an interface (paper, software, etc.).
2. **Discussion and comparison**: Discuss and compare the created interfaces.
3. **Selection of best ideas**: Retain the best ideas from each interface.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Objective
Evaluate the system by putting oneself in the user's position.

#### Protocol
- Specify scenarios (tasks and context).

#### Procedure
1. **Evaluation**: Imagine what the user would do to complete the task.
   - Does the user understand the messages and the system's behavior?
2. **Interpretation**: Consider and interpret the results.

---

### Observation

#### Objective
Identify problems with an application.

#### Procedure
1. **Select users**: Choose at least 2 users who will act independently.
2. **Define a specific task**: Solve a problem or follow a scenario.
3. **Decide on metrics**: Determine what to measure.
4. **Conduct the task**: Ask the user to perform the task (intrusive method).
   - Simple direct observation.
   - With think-aloud protocol.
   - Paired observation to watch interactions (questions, explanations).
5. **Record interactions**: Then analyze them.
   - Use paper, audio, video, or computer logs.

---

### A/B Testing

#### Objective
Evaluate the performance of two design alternatives for a component.

#### Protocol
- Two versions of the same interface, each with a variant of the component to be tested (e.g., button color).
- Define an objective (e.g., click on the tested button, a sale).
- Choose a metric to quantify interest for each version (e.g., number of clicks on the button divided by the number of views).
- Extensions for testing more than two versions or components (A/Z tests, multivariate).

#### Procedure
1. **Random version assignment**: When a user arrives at the interface, randomly present one of the two versions.
2. **Calculate success metrics**: Calculate the number of objectives achieved for each version.
