### MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

#### Overview
- MVC is the multi-agent model used by Smalltalk (Programming Language).
- The goal of this model is to have a system composed of autonomous triplets capable of communicating with each other.
- It enforces separation between data, processing, and presentation.

#### Components
- **Model**: Represents the data structure to be displayed on the screen, composed of objects.
- **View**: The external representation of the Model. It allows the user to perceive the Model (inputs) and reflects its changes (outputs). A Model can have multiple different views, while a View can be associated with only one Model.
- **Controller**: Regulates interactions between the View and the Model. It manages user actions on the View. When the user manipulates the View, the Controller informs the Model of the interactions made, which then modifies its state and informs the View of the new aspect it should take after this modification.

#### Principles
- The Model corresponds to the application's data (structures and functions).
- The View presents information to the user based on the data from the Model.
- The Controller handles interaction with the user.

#### Workflow
- A client sends a request to the application, which is analyzed by the Controller.
- The Controller asks the appropriate Model to perform processing, then returns the adapted View if the Model has not already done so.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**:
  - Synchronized multiple views.
  - Modular views and controllers.
  - Development of reusable components.
  - Internal and external interface coherence.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complexity of communication between components.

#### Example (Java)
```java
// Model
public class Student {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    // Getters and setters
}

// View
public class StudentView {
    public void printStudentDetails(String studentName, String studentId) {
        System.out.println("Student:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + studentName);
        System.out.println("ID: " + studentId);
    }
}

// Controller
public class StudentController {
    private Student model;
    private StudentView view;
    // Constructor, setters, getters
    public void updateView() {
        view.printStudentDetails(model.getName(), model.getId());
    }
}

// Main
public class MVCStudentModel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student model = retriveStudentFromDatabase();
        StudentView view = new StudentView();
        StudentController controller = new StudentController(model, view);
        controller.updateView();
        controller.setStudentName("Amina");
        controller.updateView();
    }
    private static Student retriveStudentFromDatabase() {
        Student student = new Student();
        student.setName("Amine");
        student.setId("20");
        return student;
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion
- MVC facilitates modular development, enhancing clarity and code reusability.
- Used in various platforms such as Excel, Swing, web applications, etc.
- Provides synchronized multiple views, modular views and controllers, and development of reusable components.
- However, it may introduce complexity in communication between components.
