HCI design methods aim to create effective interfaces by focusing on three core elements:

1. **Users**
2. **Their tasks**
3. **Interface evaluations**

### **1. Iterative Method**

- **Overview:** Focuses on repeated cycles of analysis, development, and evaluation to refine the interface.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Works on the entire interface during each cycle.
    - Repeats cycles until a satisfactory result is achieved.
    - Continuously adapts to new goals and user feedback.

### **2. Incremental Method**

- **Overview:** Builds the interface progressively, focusing on specific sections.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Works on one section at a time until it meets requirements.
    - Produces partial, intermediate solutions.
    - Incorporates evolving objectives and user feedback at each stage.

### **3. Iterative-Incremental Method**

- **Overview:** Combines the strengths of the iterative and incremental approaches.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Uses successive cycles to refine the overall interface.
    - Focuses incrementally on specific sections during each cycle.
    - Adapts to new objectives and insights throughout the design process.
