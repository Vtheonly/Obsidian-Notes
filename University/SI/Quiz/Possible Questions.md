**Merged List of Questions and Answers**

**From Image 1 (Test Sécurité Informatique 2021-2022, Exercice 1):**

1.  **What are the two problems that hybrid encryption solves?**
    *   Hybrid encryption solves:
        1.  The **key distribution problem** of symmetric cryptography.
        2.  The **slow speed/computational demand** of using asymmetric cryptography for large messages. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

2.  **Explain the role of a public key and a private key in digital signatures.**
    *   For digital signatures (using hash functions):
        *   The **private key** is used by the sender to encrypt the hash summary (digest) of the message. This creates the signature.
        *   The **public key** is used by the receiver to decrypt the signature (revealing the original hash summary) for verification. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

3.  **Why are Security Certificates generated by an independent entity (Certificate Authority)?**
    *   They are generated by an independent Certificate Authority (CA) to **verify the veracity of the information** and reliably **bind a public key to its true owner**, preventing impersonation and solving the problem of potentially false keys being presented. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

**From Image 2 (Questions: Cochez...):**

1.  **What security problem is solved by certificates?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** Authentication of the public key.

2.  **If you declare two arrays, A[100] and B[200] in C and try to do `strcpy(A, B)`, what will happen? (Assuming B contains more than 100 characters including the null terminator)**
    *   **Marked Answer:** Everything written in array B will be copied into array A, with an overflow.

**From Image 3 (Questions: Cochez...):**

1.  **What does a digital certificate represent?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** A means of guaranteeing the unique relationship between a public key and its true owner.

2.  **What is the main limitation of secret key (symmetric) cryptography?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** The uncertain security during the transfer (distribution) of this key.

**From Image 4 (Questions de cours (3 points)...):**

1.  **Consider a group of N people wishing to use a symmetric cryptographic system to exchange confidential information three by three. What is the minimum number of symmetric keys required?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** N(N-1)(N-2)/3!

2.  **A company uses symmetric encryption. What are the valid reasons to migrate to asymmetric encryption?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** Symmetric encryption can make key management (administration) difficult.

3.  **What happens if you encrypt a confidential message with your private key?**
    *   **Marked Answer:** The whole world (anyone with your public key) will be able to decrypt it.

**From Image 5 (Exercice 1 (Cochez... 8 points)):**

1.  **The inconvenience of asymmetric cryptography is related to:**
    *   Its **speed/performance**, being significantly slower (e.g., 1000 times slower than AES) and computationally demanding, especially for large messages. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

2.  **Forging an email consists of:**
    *   **Falsifying the sender address** (e.g., using the `MAIL FROM:` command in SMTP to specify an address different from the actual origin). (Based on `Threats.md`)

3.  **A certification authority is used for:**
    *   **Issuing digital certificates** that **authenticate the ownership of public keys** by verifying the owner's identity and binding it to the public key. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

4.  **A security policy allows for:**
    *   **Defining how risks are managed**, **establishing rules for protection/mitigation**, **monitoring**, **incident response**, and security **governance**. (Based on `Chapter 1.md`, `1 - Prerequisite.md`)

5.  **Among the steps for installing a backdoor, one finds:**
    *   Being **installed via other malware (like a Trojan or virus)** and **opening communication ports** to listen for remote commands or send data out. (Based on `Threats.md`)

6.  **I receive an email announcing I won a Coca-Cola crate. I just need to send an email to promo@acces.com. What is the possible threat?**
    *   The most direct threats described in the context are **validating your email address to spammers** by replying, or potentially falling for a **hoax**. (Based on `Threats.md`)

7.  **To mask the trace of a hacker, one uses:**
    *   A **Rootkit**, which is software designed to mask the presence of an intruder. (Based on `Threats.md`)

8.  **The SSH protocol:**
    *   Is a secure replacement for protocols like Telnet, using **asymmetric and symmetric cryptography** for secure remote access, commands, and file transfers. It provides server authentication and establishes a secure channel but is vulnerable to **Man In The Middle attacks**. (Based on `Cryptography.md`)

**From Image 6 (Exercises):**

1.  **Messaging:** By opening a Telnet session to port 25 of an SMTP server, it's possible to send an email with a fake sender. Illustrate this technique using the SMTP commands: HELO, MAIL FROM:, RCPT TO:, DATA to send a forged email.
    *   Example illustration (Based on `Threats.md`):
        ```
        telnet mail.server.com 25
        HELO fakeddomain.com
        MAIL FROM: fake_sender@fakeddomain.com  <-- Forgery
        RCPT TO: recipient@realdomain.com
        DATA
        Subject: Forged Email

        This email appears to be from fake_sender@fakeddomain.com, but it's not.
        .
        QUIT
        ```

2.  **Viruses and Malwares:**
    1.  **What is the difference between a virus and a worm?**
        *   A **worm is autonomous and can propagate on its own across networks**, while a **virus needs help from other programs** (e.g., attached to a file) to propagate. (Based on `Threats.md`)
    2.  **In what way are worms more dangerous than viruses?**
        *   Their **autonomy and network self-propagation** capability implies a potential for **faster and wider spread across networks without user intervention**, potentially causing large-scale disruption (like denial of service). (Inferred from `Threats.md`)
    3.  **Some worms which propagate via the internet do not cause any damage to the affected machines. Why are they harmful nevertheless?**
        *   They are harmful because they:
            *   **Clog network bandwidth**.
            *   Can **overload servers** (e.g., mail servers used for propagation).
            *   Often turn infected machines into part of a **botnet** used for other malicious activities (like spam or DDoS attacks). (Based on `Threats.md`, `2 - Historical Context in IT Security.md`)
    4.  **To disinfect a computer, it is recommended to restart it from a floppy disk (or clean boot media). Why?**
        *   The provided Markdown context **does not contain information** explaining this specific recommendation.
    5.  **How can a hacker proceed to install a backdoor?**
        *   By tricking a user into running a **Trojan horse** or by infecting the machine with a **virus/worm** that carries the backdoor payload. (Based on `Threats.md`)
    6.  **How can a hacker proceed to install a Trojan horse?**
        *   By distributing it via **email attachments**, making it available for **download from the internet (disguised as legitimate software)**, or through physical media (**disk exchange**). The user typically needs to execute the Trojan. (Based on `Threats.md`)
    7.  **Describe two different techniques that allow viruses not to be detected by antivirus software.**
        *   The provided Markdown context **does not describe specific evasion techniques** used by viruses (like polymorphism or metamorphism). It mentions AV disabling as a *result* of infection (Bugbear) but not the detection evasion method itself.

3.  **Virus with encrypted attachment:** Consider a variant of the W32/Beagle worm... Why is the compressed file encrypted since the password is provided in the message?
    *   The provided Markdown context **does not directly explain** this tactic. (Commonly, this is done to bypass simple content/signature scanning of attachments by email gateways, as the encrypted content is not directly scannable without the password).

4.  **Pointers in C:** *(This is a topic title, not a specific question)*
