Source address is typically spoofed.
**Issues caused:**
SMTP server flooding.
Abused servers overload (over 24 hours).
Disks filled with logs and messages.
Error messages flooding administrator mailbox.
Servers listed in blacklists.
Bandwidth congestion.
Extra costs for Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
Risk of line disconnection by ISP.
*(Reference: p. 11-14)*

### 4. What protective measures can be implemented against spam?
**Server:**
Disallow relaying.
**Source:**
Use a blacklist of servers.
**Content:**
Keyword-based anti-spam filter, format, transit time, number of recipients.
Blacklist of known spams.
*(Reference: p. 17)*

### 5. How are botnets used in spam?
Hackers use worms and viruses to install bots on infected machines.
They rent zombie networks (botnets) to spammers.

**Trojan:**
Malicious program hidden in another useful or legitimate program.
Often contains a "keylogger."
*(Reference: p. 21-23)*

### 2. What are the effects of viruses and other malwares?
Data loss.
Loss of work time.
Brand image loss.
Loss of functionality (blocked systems).
Intrusion and theft.
Loss of privacy.
*(Reference: p. 27)*

### 3. What is a backdoor?
Hidden access to a computer allowing remote management, often installed by a trojan.
*(Reference: p. 25)*

Data loss.
*(Reference: p. 31, p. 36)*

### 6. What are other common types of malwares?
**Adware:** Espionage and unwanted advertising.
**Dialers:** Fraudulent phone charges.
**Downloader:** Downloads executables in the background.
**Droppers:** Launches malware at machine startup.
**Hoax:** Computer hoaxes.
**Joke:** Computer jokes.
*(Reference: p. 31-32)*
