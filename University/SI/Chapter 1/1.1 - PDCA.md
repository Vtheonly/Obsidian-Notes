## ISO 27001 ISMS: The PDCA Cycle Merged

This summarizes the key activities within each phase of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle for establishing and managing an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

**1. PLAN (Establish the ISMS)**

*   **Define Context, Scope & Policy:**
    *   Understand the organization's internal/external context.
    *   Define the ISMS boundaries (what business activities, systems, locations are covered).
    *   Establish a high-level Information Security Policy stating management commitment and objectives.
*   **Conduct Risk Management:**
    *   **Identify Assets:** Know what needs protection (hardware, software, data, people, etc.).
    *   **Identify Threats & Vulnerabilities:** Recognize potential dangers and weaknesses.
    *   **Assess Risks:** Analyze the likelihood and potential impact of threats exploiting vulnerabilities (can be qualitative like High/Medium/Low or quantitative). Determine the risk level (e.g., using a risk matrix).
    *   **Evaluate & Prioritize:** Compare risk levels against pre-defined acceptance criteria to decide which risks need treatment.
*   **Plan Risk Treatment & Controls:**
    *   Select risk treatment options for unacceptable risks (e.g., **Reduce** by applying controls, **Avoid** the activity, **Transfer** via insurance/outsourcing, or formally **Accept** the risk).
    *   Choose specific security controls (often referencing ISO 27001 Annex A) to implement the treatment plan.
    *   Develop the **Risk Treatment Plan** and the **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** listing chosen controls and justifications.
    *   Develop supporting **Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures** detailing *how* the policy and controls will be implemented.

**2. DO (Implement and Operate the ISMS)**

*   **Implement Plans:**
    *   Put the **Risk Treatment Plan** into action by deploying the selected security controls.
    *   Implement the established **Security Policy, Standards, and Procedures** in daily operations.
*   **Manage Operations:**
    *   Run the ISMS processes consistently (e.g., access control management, backups, change management).
*   **Allocate Resources:**
    *   Provide necessary budget, tools, and personnel for ISMS operation and control implementation.
*   **Build Awareness:**
    *   Conduct security awareness training for employees and relevant parties regarding their roles and responsibilities.

**3. CHECK (Monitor and Review the ISMS)**

*   **Monitor & Measure:**
    *   Continuously monitor security events, logs, and control performance.
    *   Measure the effectiveness of controls and the ISMS against objectives.
*   **Conduct Audits & Assessments:**
    *   Perform **Internal Audits** to check if the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements and internal policies/procedures.
    *   Carry out technical checks like **Vulnerability Scanning** (identify known weaknesses) and potentially **Penetration Testing** (simulate attacks to test real-world resilience).
*   **Management Review:**
    *   Hold regular reviews by top management to assess the ISMS's overall suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness based on monitoring and audit results.
*   **Analyze & Evaluate:**
    *   Review the collected data from monitoring, audits, and tests to identify non-conformities, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

**4. ACT (Maintain and Improve the ISMS)**

*   **Address Findings:**
    *   Take **Corrective Actions** to fix the root causes of non-conformities or incidents identified during the Check phase, preventing recurrence.
*   **Implement Improvements:**
    *   Make changes to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, or suitability of the ISMS processes and controls, aiming for better performance.
*   **Respond to Change:**
    *   Update the ISMS (policies, risks, controls) in response to changes in the organization, technology, threats, legal requirements, or business objectives.
*   **Continual Improvement:**
    *   Feed the results and actions back into the **Plan** phase to start the next cycle, ensuring the ISMS evolves and improves over time.

|  **Plan**(Establish ISMS)   | • Define scope, context & policy• Map and classify assets• Conduct risk assessment (identify, analyze, evaluate)• Select controls, produce SoA & risk treatment plan                                   |
| **Do**(Implement & Operate) | • Deploy selected controls and procedures• Roll out security policy operationally• Provide awareness-raising & training• Allocate resources (people, budget, tools)                                    |
| **Check**(Monitor & Review) | • Monitor metrics, logs & control effectiveness• Perform internal audits, management reviews• Run vulnerability scans & optional penetration tests• Evaluate performance against policy and objectives |
| **Act**(Maintain & Improve) | • Tackle non-conformities with corrective actions• Implement preventive measures for potential issues• Drive continual improvements to ISMS processes• Feed changes back into the next Plan phase      |
