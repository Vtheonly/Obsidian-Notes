# Malware Types (Slides 26-37)

This section details various types of malicious software (malware) discussed in the presentation.

## Malware Introduction (Slide 26)

*   **Definition:** Malware is short for **"Malicious Software"**. It refers to any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive users access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.
*   **Conditions for a program to be malware:**
    *   The program is **hostile or intrusive**.
    *   The program is designed to **install itself on your computer without your consent**.
*   **Purpose:** Malware is used or created to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.
*   **General Term:** "Malware" is a general term used to describe a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software.

## Malware Categorization (Slide 27)

While there are many ways to categorize malware, they can primarily be classified based on three key mechanisms:

1.  **Propagation Mechanism:** How the malware spreads (e.g., network, email, website, removable media).
2.  **Triggering Mechanism:** What causes the malware to activate or execute its payload (e.g., a specific date, a user action, the execution of a specific program).
3.  **Payload:** The actions performed by the malware once it has successfully infected a victim's machine (e.g., data theft, encryption, system damage, creating a backdoor).

## Virus (Slide 28)

*   **Definition:** A computer virus is a piece of code (a portion of a program) that **replicates by inserting copies of itself into other legitimate programs** (the "host" programs).
*   **Infection:** A program containing a virus is called an infected program.
*   **Execution:** When the infected program is executed, the virus code is also executed, allowing it to potentially infect other programs and deliver its payload.
*   **Dependency:** Viruses require a host program to function and spread; they cannot exist independently.
*   **Types of Viruses:**
    *   **Boot Sector Virus:** Infects the master boot record (MBR) or boot sector of a storage device.
    *   **File Virus:** Infects executable files (.exe, .com, etc.).
    *   **Macro Virus:** Infects files containing macros, typically documents (e.g., Microsoft Word or Excel files).
    *   **Polymorphic Virus:** Changes its code signature upon replication to evade detection by antivirus software.

## Worm (Worms) (Slide 29)

*   **Definition:** A computer worm is a **standalone malicious program that replicates itself** to spread to other computers, often using a computer network.
*   **Autonomy:** Unlike a virus, a worm **does not need to attach itself to an existing program** (it doesn't require a host). It propagates as an independent entity.
*   **Propagation:** Often exploits vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications to spread automatically, usually without human interaction (beyond potentially initiating the first infection).
*   **Payload:** Many worms are designed solely to propagate and may not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, worms can also carry malicious payloads, for example:
    *   Sending multiple requests to a web server to saturate it (DoS).
    *   Spying on the host computer.
    *   Creating a backdoor for attackers.
    *   Destroying data on the infected computer.

## Logic Bomb (Slide 30)

*   **Definition:** A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will **set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met** (the trigger). It remains dormant until that trigger occurs.
*   **Installation:** Often deliberately installed, sometimes by an authorized user (like a disgruntled employee).
*   **Trigger:** The condition could be a specific date or time, the presence or absence of certain files, a particular user logging in, or a specific sequence of events.
*   **Detection:** Logic bombs are **difficult to detect** before they trigger because they remain inactive.
*   **Implications:**
    *   Highlights the need for **separation of duties** and code reviews.
    *   Reinforces the necessity for regular, reliable **backups**.

## Trojan Horse (Slide 31)

*   **Definition:** A Trojan horse (or Trojan) is a type of malware that **disguises itself as a legitimate or useful program** but contains hidden malicious functionality (the payload).
*   **Mechanism:** It relies on **social engineering** to trick users into executing it. The user must typically copy, download, or install the Trojan voluntarily, believing it to be something harmless or desirable.
*   **Replication:** Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans **are generally not capable of replicating themselves**.
*   **Analogy:** Named after the ancient Greek story of the wooden horse used to invade Troy. The "Visible action" is something useful or benign, while the "Invisible action" is malicious.

## Spyware (Spy Software) (Slide 32)

*   **Definition:** An application **installed (often unintentionally) on a computer to monitor user activity** and transmit this information to a third party without the user's consent or knowledge.
*   **Activities:** Spyware can perform a wide range of activities, including:
    *   **Recording keystrokes** (commonly known as a **Keylogger**).
    *   Capturing screenshots.
    *   Monitoring websites visited.
    *   Collecting personal information (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers).
    *   Redirecting web browsers.

## Adware (Slide 33)

*   **Definition:** Software designed to **display advertisements** on a user's screen, typically within a web browser or as pop-ups.
*   **Installation:** Often installed discreetly in the background when downloading other (often free) software, sometimes without clear permission or bundled deceptively.
*   **Impact:** While often harmless in terms of system damage, adware can be **annoying** to the user, slow down the computer, and potentially track browsing habits for targeted advertising. Some adware can border on spyware.

## Keylogger (Keystroke Logger) (Slide 34)

*   **Definition:** A keylogger records **every keystroke** made on a computer's keyboard, often without the user's authorization or knowledge.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Legitimate Uses:** Can be used as a professional IT monitoring tool (e.g., by employers monitoring company computers, with disclosure).
    *   **Criminal Uses:** Commonly used to capture sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, personal messages, etc.
*   **Type:** Often considered a specific type of spyware.

## Backdoor (Slide 35)

*   **Definition:** An application or modification that allows **remote, unauthorized access** to a computer system, bypassing normal security mechanisms (like authentication).
*   **Control:** Gives the attacker near-total control over the compromised system, allowing them to perform a wide range of actions (monitor, interfere, intercept, modify, capture data, execute commands, etc.).
*   **Purpose:** Used to **bypass existing security controls**. Can be part of the original software (intentionally or unintentionally left by developers) or planted by attackers after gaining initial access.
*   **Benefit to Attacker:** Provides **persistent, privileged access** to a system once it has been initially compromised.
*   **Replication:** Backdoors are generally standalone malware types that **do not replicate** themselves.

## Ransomware (Slide 36)

*   **Definition:** A category of malware (like Cryptolocker) that aims to **encrypt the victim's data** (files, documents, databases) and then **demand a ransom** (payment, usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key needed to recover the data.
*   **Impact:** Makes data inaccessible to the user, potentially causing significant disruption or data loss if no backups are available or the ransom isn't paid (and even if paid, decryption isn't guaranteed).
*   **Propagation:**
    *   Primarily spreads through **phishing emails** (malicious attachments or links).
    *   Can also spread via **infected USB drives**, exploitation of **vulnerable systems exposed to the internet**, or as an **internal threat** within an organization.

## Rootkit (Slide 37)

*   **Definition:** A (set of) program(s) used to **modify the standard functionality of the operating system** in order to **hide malicious activity** carried out by the attacker or other malware.
*   **Mechanism:** They often replace common system utilities (like `kernel` components, `netstat`, `ls`, `ps` in Unix/Linux, or core system files/APIs in Windows) with modified versions. These altered utilities filter out information related to the attacker's presence (processes, files, network connections) before displaying results to the user or administrator.
*   **Goal:** To **mask the fact that a system has been compromised**, allowing the attacker to gain and maintain **root-level (administrator) access** persistently and stealthily. They can potentially spread to other machines on the network.
*   **Components:** A rootkit can be composed of various malicious components, including:
    *   Spyware elements (traffic/keystroke monitoring).
    *   Backdoors for continued access.
    *   Log file modifiers/cleaners to erase traces.
    *   Tools to attack other machines on the network.
    *   Mechanisms to modify existing system tools to evade detection.
