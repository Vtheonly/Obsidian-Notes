# Chapter 2 and 3

## I. Introduction, Definition, and History

### 1. What is cryptography?
Cryptography is the science that uses mathematics for data encryption and decryption.
*(Reference: p. 20)*

### 2. What are the main types of cryptography?
- **Transposition Cryptography:** Rearranging the order of elements in information.
- **Substitution Cryptography:** Replacing elements of information with others.
*(Reference: p. 12)*

### 3. What is steganography and how does it differ from cryptography?
- **Steganography:** Information is concealed within other information to make it invisible.
- **Cryptography:** Information is modified to make it incomprehensible.
*(Reference: p. 8-11)*

### 4. What is the history of Caesar cipher?
Julius Caesar used a cipher based on a three-character shift in the alphabet to secure his messages.
*(Reference: p. 5)*

## II. Current Cryptography

### Symmetric Cryptography

#### 1. What is symmetric cryptography and what are its advantages/disadvantages?
**Definition:**
Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting a message (ke = kd = k).
**Advantages:**
- Speed
**Disadvantages:**
- Key distribution
*(Reference: p. 32-35)*

#### 2. What are the main algorithms used in symmetric cryptography?
- DES
- 3DES
- AES
*(Reference: p. 32-34)*

#### 3. How does random substitution encryption work?
**Principle:** Replace each letter of the plaintext with another based on a random key.
**Number of possible keys:** 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
**Cryptanalysis:** Using letter frequency in the French language.
*(Reference: p. 27-29)*

### Asymmetric Cryptography

#### 1. What is asymmetric cryptography and what are its advantages/disadvantages?
**Definition:**
Asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
**Advantages:**
- Easier key distribution
**Disadvantages:**
- Slower than symmetric cryptography
*(Reference: p. 42-48)*

#### 2. How does RSA encryption work?
**Public Key:** (n, e)
**Private Key:** (n, d)
**Encryption:** c = m^e mod n
**Decryption:** m = c^d mod n
*(Reference: p. 52-53)*

#### 3. What are other examples of asymmetric cryptography?
- Exponentiation of large prime numbers (RSA)
- Discrete logarithm problem (ElGamal)
- Knapsack problem (Merkle-Hellman)
*(Reference: p. 51)*

#### 4. What are the main asymmetric cryptography algorithms and their uses?
- RSA: Encryption and digital signatures
- Diffie-Hellman: Key exchange
- ElGamal: Encryption
*(Reference: p. 51, p. 84)*

## III. Digital Signature and Certificates

### 1. What is a digital signature?
It's a data string associating a message with the entity it originates from, ensuring authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.
*(Reference: p. 60)*

### 2. How does a digital signature with a hash function work?
**Hash Function:** Processes variable input and gives fixed output (160 bits).
**Digital Signature:** The hashed message is encrypted with the private key to obtain the digital signature.
*(Reference: p. 64-66)*

### 3. What are the main hash function algorithms?
- MD5: Generates a 128-bit hash.
- SHA-1: Generates a 160-bit hash.
*(Reference: p. 67)*

### 4. What problems are associated with asymmetric cryptography and how do digital certificates solve them?
**Problem:**
False public key that may belong to a hacker.
**Solution:**
Digital certificates are issued by a Certification Authority (CA) and contain the public key along with user identity information.
*(Reference: p. 70-75)*

### 5. What is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?
It's an infrastructure managing public keys on a large scale.
**Functions:**
- Registration and issuance
- Storage and distribution
- Revocation and status verification
- Certificate usage
*(Reference: p. 80-81)*

## IV. Cryptography Applications

### 1. What are the main secure communication protocols?
- **SSH:** Uses asymmetric (RSA) and symmetric cryptography.
- **SSL/TLS:** Ensures authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.
- **VPN:** Uses IPSEC protocol, consisting of four protocols:
  - AH: Authentication Header
  - ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload
  - IPComp: Compression
  - IKE: Internet Key Exchange
*(Reference: p. 87-94)*

### 2. What is PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and how does it work?
**Definition:**
A cryptography software combining features of both public-key and symmetric cryptography.
**Operation:**
- Generates a one-time symmetric session key.
- Encrypts plaintext with this key.
- Encrypts the session key with the recipient's public key.
*(Reference: p. 97-99)*

### 3. How does the Kerberos protocol work?
**Definition:**
A network authentication protocol using tickets to replace clear text passwords.
**Key Elements:**
- Client (C): Has its own private key KC.
- KDC (Key Distribution Center): Knows keys KC and KTGS.
- TGS (Ticket Granting Server): Has its own private key KTGS.
- Server (S): Has its own private key KS.
*(Reference: p. 101-102)*

### 4. What are other modern encryption systems?
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Quantum cryptography
- MAC (Message Authentication Code)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- TESLA
*(Reference: p. 84)*
