# Chapter 5

After analyzing the document "Chapter 05 (Application Security BufOver Attacks).pdf," here is a list of potential review questions, along with answers and page references:

## 1. What is an application vulnerability?
**Answer:**
Application vulnerabilities refer to flaws in applications caused by poor programming or intentionally left as entry points.
*(Reference: Page 2)*

## 2. What are the common types of application vulnerabilities?
**Answer:**
Buffer overflows
Improperly validated user inputs
Concurrency issues
Format strings
*(Reference: Page 2)*

## 3. What is a buffer overflow?
**Answer:**
Buffer overflow is a vulnerability caused by exceeding the capacity of a memory buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent data.
*(Reference: Page 4)*

## 4. How does a buffer overflow work?
**Answer:**
During program execution, the processor saves the return address in the stack. If a procedure writes more bytes than the buffer size, it overwrites the return address, allowing an attacker to redirect the execution flow to malicious code.
*(Reference: Page 6)*

## 5. Why is the C language vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks?
**Answer:**
The simplicity and efficiency of the C language often prevail over integrity checks, leaving the responsibility to the programmer to avoid errors.
*(Reference: Page 9)*

## 6. What are the steps in exploiting a buffer overflow?
**Answer:**
Overwrite the return address in the stack.
Indicate a new return address pointing to malicious code.
Execute the malicious code (e.g., a UNIX shell).
*(Reference: Page 8)*

## 7. What is an SQL injection attack?
**Answer:**
SQL injection exploits security flaws in an application interacting with a database by injecting unintended SQL into the query, compromising security.
*(Reference: Page 14)*

## 8. What are the risks associated with SQL injection attacks?
**Answer:**
Theft of sensitive data (e.g., credit cards)
Logging in as an administrator
Modifying product prices
Cheating in games
*(Reference: Pages 17-19)*

## 9. What are the types of SQL injections?
**Answer:**
Blind-based
Time-based
Error-based
Union-based
Stacked queries
Boolean-based
Out-of-band
*(Reference: Page 23)*

## 10. How to prevent SQL injection attacks?
**Answer:**
Check the format of user-entered data
Escape special characters
Use regular expressions
Use stored procedures or parameterized SQL queries
*(Reference: Pages 24-26)*

## 11. What is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack?
**Answer:**
XSS attack uses web resources to execute malicious scripts in the victim's web browser or in a scriptable application.
*(Reference: Page 27)*

## 12. What are the risks associated with XSS attacks?
**Answer:**
Information theft (sessions, cookies)
Message modification
Phishing redirection
Remote browser control
*(Reference: Pages 31-33)*

## 13. What are the types of XSS attacks?
**Answer:**
Stored XSS attacks: Malicious content stored in a server database
Reflected XSS attacks: Malicious content delivered via a URL
DOM-based XSS: Attack in the browser without server interaction
*(Reference: Pages 34-36)*

## 14. How to prevent XSS attacks?
**Answer:**
Cleanse user-entered data
Convert special characters into HTML or URL entities
Disable client-side scripts
*(Reference: Page 39)*

## 15. What is a CSRF attack?
**Answer:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an authenticated user to perform an unwanted action on a web application in which they are authenticated.
*(Reference: Page 40)*
