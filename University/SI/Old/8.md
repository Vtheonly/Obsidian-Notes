1. **Why is user training important for security?**
   - *Response*: User awareness informs them about the weak security of communication tools and the importance of not disclosing sensitive information. It reduces the risk of inadvertently disclosing passwords and other crucial information.
   - *Reference*: Pages 4-5

2. **What is a company charter and what is its role in security?**
   - *Response*: A company charter is a document that employees must read and sign. It defines their rights and duties, showing their individual responsibilities in terms of security.
   - *Reference*: Page 7

3. **What are the main tools needed to protect a workstation?**
   - *Response*: Antivirus, Anti-Spyware, Personal Firewalls (e.g., Windows Firewall), Vulnerability Patching.
   - *Reference*: Page 9

4. **What are the recommended actions to secure a workstation?**
   - *Response*: Verify and set up the jumper prohibiting BIOS reprogramming, Disallow booting from floppy disks, Regularly backup data, Avoid multi-boot to minimize vulnerabilities.
   - *Reference*: Page 10

5. **What are the main detection methods used by antivirus software?**
   - *Response*: Signature Analysis (using a signature database), Code Analysis (static and dynamic code analysis), Integrity Check (verifying if executable files have been modified).
   - *Reference*: Page 12

6. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of code analysis by antivirus software?**
   - *Response*: 
     - *Advantages*: No need for signature databases, Detects new attacks not recognized by signatures.
     - *Disadvantages*: The solution is not mathematically perfect, Generates numerous false alerts.
   - *Reference*: Page 13

7. **How to ensure effective antivirus protection in a company?**
   - *Response*: Use detection methods jointly, Automatically update antivirus software, Use antivirus software at all levels of the network (workstations, file servers, mail servers, proxies).
   - *Reference*: Pages 14-15

8. **Why should workstations be protected by antivirus software?**
   - *Response*: All computers should be protected by antivirus software with automatic updates. New machines inserted, especially laptops, should also be managed.
   - *Reference*: Page 16

9. **Why should file servers be protected by antivirus software?**
   - *Response*: File servers contain files from multiple users, so an infection can be dangerous. All files should be analyzed during writing or reading. Updates and automatic log analysis are necessary.
   - *Reference*: Page 18

10. **What are the recommendations for protecting mail servers?**
    - *Response*: Analyze emails before placing them in the recipient's mailbox, Manage all types of attachments, even zipped files, Remove detected viruses and inform concerned parties (sender, recipient, administrator), Regularly update antivirus and mail server software.
    - *Reference*: Pages 19-20

11. **Why should mail, web, and ftp proxies be secured?**
    - *Response*: 
      - *Mail*: Isolate mail servers from the Internet to prevent attacks, Intercept viruses before they enter the internal network, 24/7 maintenance required.
      - *Web and ftp*: Web pages and downloaded software may contain viruses. Proxies should analyze all accessible documents and remove detected viruses.
    - *Reference*: Pages 22, 24

12. **What measures to take for effective filtering of new viruses?**
    - *Response*: Filter unnecessary attachments (.exe, .bat, .vbs), Allow only certain file types (.doc, .xls), Install the general filter on all proxies.
    - *Reference*: Page 26

13. **What types of mobile code can pose security problems?**
    - *Response*: JAVA Applets, ActiveX.
