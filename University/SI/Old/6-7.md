7. **What is IP Spoofing?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - IP Spoofing involves forging the source address of a packet to make it appear as if the request is coming from an authorized machine.
   - **Reference:** Page 14

8. **How does an IP Spoofing attack based on TCP work?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - TCP uses initial sequence numbers (ISNs) for each new connection.
     - The attacker opens multiple connections to obtain the current ISNs and their increment method.
     - The attacker launches the forged connection using the last incremented ISN according to the detected method.
   - **Reference:** Page 16

9. **What is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - A DoS attack aims to prevent the use of a machine or service by saturating a router or server.
   - **Reference:** Page 20

10. **What are the types of DoS attacks?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Local DoS: Disk space saturation, infinite fork() loop, etc.
      - Network-based DoS: Bandwidth consumption, SYN Flood, mailbombing, etc.
    - **Reference:** Page 21

11. **What is a SYN Flood attack and how to protect against it?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - SYN Flood: Flooding of SYN packets with a spoofed source address to saturate the connection list in the SYN_RECV state.
      - Protection: Using a FIFO queue for SYN_RECV connections.
    - **Reference:** Pages 22-23

12. **What is ARP Spoofing?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - ARP Spoofing involves polluting ARP caches with false MAC/IP address associations to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Reference:** Page 25

13. **How to protect against ARP Spoofing?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Use static associations.
      - Monitor association changes with tools like arpwatch.
    - **Reference:** Page 26

14. **What is DNS Cache Poisoning?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - DNS Cache Poisoning aims to inject false entries into the DNS cache to redirect traffic to malicious sites.
    - **Reference:** Page 27

15. **What is a sniffer and which protocols are vulnerable?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Sniffer: Tool using sockets in promiscuous mode to capture network traffic.
      - Vulnerable protocols: telnet, rsh, rlogin, rexec, ftp, http (basic authentication), pop, imap.
    - **Reference:** Pages 28-29

16. **What is a Smurf attack?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - A Smurf attack involves sending an ICMP "echo request" frame to a broadcast address to saturate the target machine.
    - **Reference:** Page 32

17. **How to protect against a Smurf attack?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Prohibit responding to ICMP frames on broadcast addresses at the router or machine level.
    - **Reference:** Page 33

18. **What is social engineering and what are its principles?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Social engineering: Attack technique based on human relationships.
      - Principles: Context (company's organization chart), audacity/bluff, luck, calculated patience.
    - **Reference:** Pages 34-35

19. **What is a DDoS attack?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack aims to collapse a machine or saturate a victim's bandwidth using multiple compromised machines.
    - **Reference:** Pages 36-37

20. **What is a botnet and how is it used?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - A botnet is a network of machines controlled by a "bot herder" to:
        - Send spam
        - Steal sensitive information (keylogger)
        - Install spyware
        - Paralyze a network (DDoS)
        - Install a malicious website (phishing)
    - **Reference:** Pages 40-41

21. **What is a man-in-the-middle attack and which protocols can be compromised?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Man-in-the-middle: Attack where the attacker intercepts between two parties to listen or modify their communications.

    - **Reference:** Page 42

22. **What are the steps of an intrusion attack according to the hacker's method?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Information gathering
      - Systematic scanning (scan)
      - Enumeration of services
      - Intrusion
      - Privilege escalation
      - Plundering (information theft)
      - Erasing traces
    - **Reference:** Pages 44-48

23. **How to protect against intrusion attacks?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Install security patches
      - Only install strictly necessary software modules
      - Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems
    - **Reference:** Page 51

24. **What tools can be used for information gathering?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Website: General information, security policy, links, HTML source code

25. **What is privilege escalation and how can the attacker achieve it?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - Privilege escalation involves increasing privileges on a system, for example, by installing a script that the administrator mistakenly executes or by installing a sniffer.
