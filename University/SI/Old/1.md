# Chapter 1

## I. Introduction to Computer Security

### 1. What is computer security?
Computer security refers to all the measures implemented to reduce the vulnerability of a system against accidental or intentional threats.
*(Reference: p. 33)*

### 2. What are the fundamental requirements and objectives of computer security?
- **Confidentiality:** Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to exchanged resources.
- **Integrity:** Ensure that data has not been altered.
- **Availability:** Ensure the proper functioning of the information system.
- **Non-repudiation:** Ensure that a transaction cannot be denied.
- **Authentication:** Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to resources.
*(Reference: p. 36-42)*

### 3. What are the main security flaws?
- Default installation of software and hardware.
- Unperformed updates.
- Non-existent or default passwords.
- Unused services retained.
- Unexploited traces.
*(Reference: p. 82-84)*

### 4. What is a security audit?
A security audit involves relying on a trusted third party to validate the protection measures implemented. The objective is to verify that each security policy rule is correctly applied.
*(Reference: p. 86-87)*

## II. Threats (security flaws, attacks, and vulnerabilities)

### 1. What are the different threats in computer security?
- Viruses, worms, trojans, and others
- Application vulnerabilities
- Network vulnerabilities
- Espionage
*(Reference: p. 9)*

## III. Protections

### 1. What are the protection measures against threats in computer security?
- User training
- Workstation
- Antivirus
- Authentication and encryption
- Firewall: translation, filtering, and proxies
- Intrusion detection
- Secure communications and applications
- VPNs
*(Reference: p. 11)*

## IV. Security Management

### 1. What is the approach to securing an information system (IS) in a network?
- Analysis of the situation
- Risk analysis
- Security policy
- Security measures
- Implementation
- Validation
*(Reference: p. 44-80)*

### 2. What is a security policy and what are its key elements?
A security policy aims to define the protection measures to be implemented. Key elements include:
- Identify risks and their consequences
- Develop rules and procedures
- Monitoring and technological watch
- Actions to take in case of problems
*(Reference: p. 63-68)*

### 3. What is risk analysis in computer security and what are its steps?
- Inventory of system elements to protect
- Inventory of possible threats
- Estimation of the probability of these threats occurring
- Estimation of the relative cost of each incident
*(Reference: p. 55-60)*

# History

### 1. Who is Kevin Mitnick and why is he important in the history of computer security?
Kevin Mitnick is a hacker who initially attacked telephone networks and servers. He was arrested after penetrating the machines of Tsutomu Shimomura's supercomputing center. He became a computer security consultant and published a book on social engineering.
*(Reference: p. 20-22)*

### 2. What happened during the 2000 DDoS attack?
In February 2000, several major websites (eBay, CNN, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) became inaccessible for several hours due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
*(Reference: p. 23-24)*

### 3. What other historical attacks and threats have marked the evolution of computer security?
- Melissa and other bugs
- Viruses, worms, spyware
- Network attacks
*(Reference: p. 25)*
