Let’s break down the **Kasiski examination** (often just called the "Kasiski method") and **explain how it works**, especially the part involving **repeated patterns** and the **PGCD (GCD in English: Greatest Common Divisor)** to find the key length.

---

## 🧠 What is the Kasiski Method?

The Kasiski examination is used to **crack the Vigenère cipher**, a polyalphabetic cipher. The goal is to **find the length of the secret key** used in the cipher. Once you know the key length, decrypting the message becomes much easier.

## 📌 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🧩 Step 1: Find repeated patterns (like "NEBA")

**What to look for:**  
You scan the ciphertext for **repeated sequences** of letters (usually 3 or more letters). For example, you might find something like:

```
...NEBA...     <- appears at position 10  
...NEBA...     <- appears again at position 38  
```

So here, "NEBA" appears more than once.

**Why do patterns repeat?**  
Because **if the same plaintext** is encrypted with the **same part of the key**, it creates the same ciphertext. Since Vigenère is periodic (it repeats the key), if a word in plaintext matches a previous word and the same key letters are applied, the resulting encrypted text will be the same.

---

### 📏 Step 2: Measure the distances between the repeated patterns

You calculate the **distance (in characters)** between each repeated pattern:

- First "NEBA" at index 10
    
- Second "NEBA" at index 38
    

**Distance = 38 - 10 = 28**

If you find more than two occurrences, you do the same:

- Third "NEBA" at index 66 → 66 - 38 = 28 again
    

So now you have distances like:  
`28, 28, ...`

---

### 📐 Step 3: Take the **GCD (PGCD)** of those distances

Once you have distances, you calculate the **GCD (PGCD in French)** of them:

- GCD(28, 28) = 28 → That suggests the key length could be 28
    
- If you had distances like 24, 12, 36 → GCD(24, 12, 36) = 12 → Key length likely = 12
    

Why GCD?  
Because the distance between two repetitions is likely a multiple of the **key length**. The GCD helps find the most likely length that **divides all the intervals** evenly — which is a strong hint for the actual key size.

---

## 🧪 Example

### Ciphertext:

```
WIVV QZX NEBA XYZ...NEBA...
```

"NEBA" repeats:

- At index 10
    
- Again at index 40
    

→ Distance = 30

Let’s say you find other repeating patterns and get these distances:

- 30
    
- 60
    
- 15
    

Then:

- GCD(30, 60, 15) = **15**
    

🔑 So the key length is **probably 15**.

---

## ❓Why is this useful?

Because **once you know the key length**, you can:

1. Split the ciphertext into **blocks**, each encrypted with the **same Caesar cipher** (since each letter of the Vigenère key encrypts one stream).
    
2. Then use **frequency analysis** on each stream to break the Caesar cipher and recover the full key.

## Summary (TL;DR)

|Step|What You Do|Why|
|---|---|---|
|1.|Find repeated sequences (e.g., "NEBA")|Likely caused by same plaintext encrypted with same key segment|
|2.|Measure distances between their positions|These are usually multiples of the key length|
|3.|Compute GCD of all distances|Most likely the key length|
