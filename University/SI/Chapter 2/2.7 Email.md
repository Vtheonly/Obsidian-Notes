Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of the secure email process you‚Äôve outlined, restructured to be easier to internalize without sacrificing technical rigor. I‚Äôll explain both the **mechanics** and the **why behind each step**, linking them directly to concepts from your cryptography slides and TD2 exercises.

## üõ°Ô∏è What is Secure Email?

A secure email aims to achieve:

- **Confidentiality** ‚Äì Only the intended recipient can read the email.
    
- **Integrity** ‚Äì The content wasn‚Äôt tampered with.
    
- **Authenticity** ‚Äì The sender is who they claim to be.
    
- **Non-repudiation** ‚Äì The sender cannot deny sending the message.
    

This is achieved using a combination of **encryption, digital signatures, and key trust**.

## üîê Part I ‚Äì Confidentiality via Hybrid Encryption

### ‚û§ 1. Generate a Random Session Key

- Alice wants to send an email to Bob.
    
- Her software creates a **random symmetric key** (AES, for instance).
    
- **Why?** Because symmetric encryption is **fast and efficient** for large data like email content. (Slide 47: AES)
    

### ‚û§ 2. Encrypt the Email Content

- Alice encrypts the actual body of the email using this symmetric key.
    
- **Result:** `Encrypted_Email = AES(plaintext, session_key)`
    

### ‚û§ 3. Encrypt the Session Key with Bob‚Äôs Public Key

- The session key itself is encrypted using **Bob‚Äôs public key** (asymmetric encryption ‚Äì RSA).
    
- **Result:** `Encrypted_Session_Key = RSA_encrypt(session_key, K_pub_Bob)`
    
- **Why?** Because Bob is the only one who can decrypt it with his private key.
    

### ‚û§ 4. Send Encrypted Data

- Alice sends Bob:
    
    - `Encrypted_Email`
        
    - `Encrypted_Session_Key`
        

### ‚û§ 5. Bob Decrypts the Session Key

- Bob uses his **private key** to decrypt the session key:
    
    - `Decrypted_Session_Key = RSA_decrypt(Encrypted_Session_Key, K_priv_Bob)`
        

### ‚û§ 6. Bob Decrypts the Email Content

- With the session key, Bob decrypts the email:
    
    - `Decrypted_Email = AES_decrypt(Encrypted_Email, Decrypted_Session_Key)`
        

### üîÅ Summary of Confidentiality

|Operation|Algorithm Used|Key Used|
|---|---|---|
|Content encryption|Symmetric (AES)|Random session key|
|Session key encryption|Asymmetric (RSA)|Bob‚Äôs **public** key|
|Session key decryption|Asymmetric (RSA)|Bob‚Äôs **private** key|
|Content decryption|Symmetric (AES)|Decrypted session key|

## ‚úçÔ∏è Part II ‚Äì Integrity, Authenticity, and Non-Repudiation via Digital Signature

### ‚û§ 1. Hash the Message

- Alice computes a **hash** of the original message using SHA-256 or similar:
    
    - `Hash_A = SHA256(plaintext)`
        
- **Why?** A hash ensures **message integrity**. Any change will result in a different hash. (Slide 102)
    

### ‚û§ 2. Sign the Hash with Her Private Key

- Alice signs the hash using her **private key**:
    
    - `Signature = RSA_encrypt(Hash_A, K_priv_Alice)`
        
- **Why?** Only Alice can generate this signature; anyone with her public key can verify it.
    

### ‚û§ 3. Attach Signature to the Email

- Alice includes the signature with the message (optionally before encryption).
    

### ‚û§ 4. Bob Verifies Signature

- Bob:
    
    - Computes his own hash: `Hash_B = SHA256(received_plaintext)`
        
    - Decrypts the signature using Alice‚Äôs **public key**:
        
        - `Hash_A = RSA_decrypt(Signature, K_pub_Alice)`
            
    - Compares: `Hash_A == Hash_B`
        

**If they match:**

- The message **hasn‚Äôt changed** (integrity),
    
- It was **indeed signed by Alice** (authenticity),
    
- She **can‚Äôt deny it** (non-repudiation).

## üßæ Part III ‚Äì Trusting Public Keys

A key technical challenge is ensuring that the public keys used are **authentic**.

### ‚û§ A. Certificates and PKI (S/MIME style)

- Alice's public key is embedded in a **digital certificate** (X.509).
    
- It‚Äôs signed by a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
    
- Bob‚Äôs software trusts CAs and thus trusts Alice‚Äôs public key.
    

**Used in S/MIME.**  
(Slides 114‚Äì125, especially 123 on chain of trust.)

### ‚û§ B. Web of Trust (PGP style)

- No central CA.
    
- Alice gives her public key directly to Bob or posts it on a public keyserver.
    
- Other trusted users can **sign her key** (vouch for her identity).
    
- Bob might trust Alice directly or because someone he trusts has signed her key.

## üîí Why Hybrid Encryption?

**Asymmetric encryption** (RSA) is slow and not meant for bulk data.  
**Symmetric encryption** (AES) is fast but needs secure key exchange.  
**Solution:** Use both. This is the hybrid model behind **PGP** and **S/MIME**.

---

## üß† Final Thoughts

- If **confidentiality** is all you need ‚Üí Just encrypt using recipient‚Äôs public key.
    
- If you need **integrity/authenticity** ‚Üí Use digital signatures.
    
- If you want **both** (which is standard for secure email): Use hybrid encryption + digital signatures.
    
- **Don‚Äôt forget trust** ‚Äì none of this matters if you use a fake public key.
