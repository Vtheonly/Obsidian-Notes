## I. Introduction: Setting the Stage with History

*   **Course Progression:** This marks the beginning of **Part 1** of the IT Security program, focusing on the **Introduction to IT Security**.
*   **Methodology:** Before diving into fundamental concepts and definitions, the professor emphasizes the importance of understanding some **historical context** ("un peu d'historique").
*   **Rationale:** Historical events and figures illustrate the evolution of threats and the growing necessity for robust security measures.

## II. Case Study 1: Kevin Mitnick - The Famous Hacker

*   **Significance:** Presented as a seminal figure ("personne assez célèbre") without whom a discussion of security would be incomplete.
*   **Background:**
    *   Known initially as a **"pirate informatique"** (computer hacker).
    *   Actively sought by authorities.
*   **Early Exploits:**
    *   Started by hacking **telephone networks** (phreaking).
    *   Attacked machines belonging to companies (specifically mentioning penetrating a DEC environment - implied by "simon simon," likely referring to VMS systems at Digital Equipment Corporation).
    *   Gained unauthorized access to an **email server** of a company (Wayne?).
    *   Accessed the mailbox of **John Markoff**, a journalist (who covered Mitnick's activities).
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Served **five years in prison**.
    *   Was subsequently **forbidden from using a computer** for two years, highlighting the perceived danger he posed.
*   **Transformation (Post-2000):**
    *   Transitioned into a role as an **IT Security Consultant**.
    *   Authored several influential books covering topics like:
        *   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people to gain access or information (a technique Mitnick was famous for).
        *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Systems designed to detect malicious activity.
    *   Became a recognized **reference** in the field of IT security, leveraging his past experiences.

> **Elaboration:** The Mitnick case study serves multiple purposes:
> *   It illustrates the capabilities and evolution of individual hackers.
> *   It introduces key concepts like **phreaking** and **social engineering**.
> *   It shows the real-world consequences of cybercrime (legal action).
> *   It highlights the fascinating (and sometimes controversial) transition from notorious hacker ("black hat") to security expert ("white hat" or consultant), demonstrating that understanding attacker methods is crucial for defense.

## III. Case Study 2: The February 2000 DDoS Attacks - Large-Scale Disruption

*   **Significance:** Described as an event that "shook" ("bouleversé") the world of IT security, demonstrating a different type of threat.
*   **The Event (February 2000):**
    *   Sudden **inaccessibility** and **non-functionality** of several major web servers.
    *   Affected high-profile companies including **eBay, CNN, Amazon, and Microsoft**.
*   **The Cause:**
    *   Servers were **"inondées" (flooded)** with an enormous amount ("flux énorme") of information/traffic.
    *   The traffic volume reached a very high rate, mentioned as **1 Gigabit per second** (a massive amount for the year 2000).
    *   This flood resulted in the **complete shutdown** ("arrêt complet") of the targeted servers.
*   **The Perpetrator:**
    *   The suspect identified (subtitles mention "que salaires," likely a mishearing/mistranscription of the hacker's alias, widely known as **"Mafiaboy"** - Michael Calce).
    *   Surprisingly, he was a **15-year-old** Canadian.
    *   Used an **automated program** ("programme automatique") he had designed.
    *   This program allowed him to compromise and control **75 other machines** (effectively creating a small botnet).
*   **The Method: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
    *   The attack is explicitly identified as a **"déni de service distribué" (DDoS)** attack.
    *   These compromised machines were used to simultaneously flood the target servers. (The subtitles mention targeting FTP servers, which is possible but DDoS typically targets web/service ports; the core point is server overload).
    *   The professor notes that DDoS attacks **will be explained in more detail later** in the course.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   The teenager was arrested in Canada.
    *   Due to being a minor, he was sentenced to **eight months in a youth detention center**.

> **Elaboration:** This case study highlights:
> *   The vulnerability of even major online services to **Denial of Service** attacks.
> *   The concept of **Distributed** attacks, where multiple compromised machines (a **botnet**, though the term isn't explicitly used) are leveraged for greater impact.
> *   The power of **automated tools** in executing large-scale attacks.
> *   The fact that significant cyber incidents can be caused by relatively young individuals.
> *   The clear impact on business continuity and availability.

## IV. Conclusion: The Catalyst for Change

*   **Overall Impact:** The professor concludes that these events (Mitnick, the 2000 DDoS attacks, and others like them) served as critical wake-up calls.
*   **Shift in Mindset:** They "pushed people to think correctly and seriously" ("poussé les gens à réfléchir correctement et sérieusement") about the need for robust protection of their IT systems.

> **Takeaway:** These historical examples are not just stories; they represent key moments that shaped the field of IT security, underscoring the tangible risks and driving the development of the security practices and technologies that will be studied in the remainder of the course.
