### Software Engineering Modeling

#### Modeling: 
- **Definition:** Simplifying reality, abstraction, subjective view.
- **Objective of modeling:**
  - Better understanding of a concept or object (modeling in physics).
  - Better construction (modeling in engineering).
- **In Software Engineering:**
  - Modeling equals specification and design.
  - It helps in building software based on client requirements.
- **Principle:**
  - A good drawing is better than a long speech, but only if it is understood by everyone in the same way.

#### Modeling Language (UML)
- **Language:**
  - Syntax and writing rules.
  - Standardized graphical notations and representations.
  - Translated into English as "Unified Modeling Language" (UML is not a development method).
- **Of Modeling:**
  - Abstraction of system functioning and structure.
  - Specification and design.
- **Unified:**
  - Fusion of several previous notations like Booch, OMT, OOSE.
  - Standard defined by the OMG (Object Management Group).
- **In summary:**
  - UML is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, building, and documenting software.
  - It is an object-oriented modeling language.

### The Need for Modeling in Software Engineering

- **Necessity for Modeling in Software Construction:**
  - Particularly for large-scale software.
  - Modeling static and dynamic aspects.
  - Modeling at different levels of abstraction and from various perspectives.
  - Independent of the development process.
  - Provides clear and precise modeling of the structure and behavior of a system, regardless of any specific method or programming language.
  - Provides foundations for specifying, building, visualizing, and describing software system components.

- **Requirement for Standardized Modeling Languages:**
  - Utilization of UML (Unified Modeling Language).
  - Semi-formal language.
  - Widely used standard.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - Efficient approach to software design.
  - Language-independent.

### UML: A Tool for Software Modeling

- **Not a Design Method:**
  - UML is an independent tool, not tied to any specific design methodology.
- **Graphical Language:**
  - Comprises a set of diagrams for modeling software from various perspectives and levels of abstraction.
- **Object-Oriented Modeling:**
  - Represents the system as a collection of interacting objects.
- **Representation from Different Viewpoints:**
  - **Use Case View:** Illustrates actors and expected requirements.
  - **Logical View:** Depicts internal workings to meet requirements.
  - **Implementation View:** Displays dependencies between modules.
  - **Process View:** Exhibits system dynamics.
  - **Deployment View:** Depicts the software's environmental organization.

### UML Diagrams

- UML 2.5 version offers 14 types of diagrams, hierarchically dependent.
- Modeling at all levels throughout the development process.

**Structural Diagrams:**
1. Class Diagram
2. Object Diagram
3. Component Diagram
4. Deployment Diagram
5. Package Diagram
6. Composite Structure Diagram
7. Profile Diagram

**Behavioral Diagrams:**
1. Use Case Diagram
2. State Machine Diagram
3. Activity Diagram

**Interaction Diagrams:**
1. Sequence Diagram
2. Communication Diagram
3. Interaction Overview Diagram
4. Timing Diagram


### Example of Diagrams Utilization

**Requirement Analysis: Specification**
- Use Case Diagrams: User needs
- Sequence Diagrams: Interaction scenarios between users and the software, viewed from the outside
- Activity Diagrams: Sequence of actions representing software behavior

**Design**
- Class Diagrams: Internal structure of the software
- Object Diagrams: Internal state of the software at a given moment
- State Machine Diagrams: Evolution of an object's state
- Sequence Diagrams: Interaction scenarios with users or within the software
- Component Diagrams: Physical components of the software
- Deployment Diagrams: Hardware organization of the software

### Modeling Axes of a System

**Static Model (what the system IS)**
- Class Diagram
- Object Diagram
- Component Diagram
- Deployment Diagram

**Functional (what the system DOES)**
- Use Case Diagram
- Collaboration Diagram

**Dynamic (how the system EVOLVES)**
- Sequence Diagram
- Collaboration Diagram
- State Machine Diagram
- Activity Diagram
