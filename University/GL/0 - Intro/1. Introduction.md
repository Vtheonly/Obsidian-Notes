### Software Lifecycle

- **The quality of the manufacturing process ensures the quality of the product.**
- To obtain high-quality software, the development process must be well-managed:
  - A software’s life comprises different stages.
  - The succession of these stages forms the software lifecycle.
  - It is essential to control the succession of these stages.

### Software Lifecycles

- **In developing a simple program by one person, three phases can be distinguished:**
  - Problem analysis phase
  - Coding and debugging phase
  - Operation phase (the program is operational)

- **This approach is not suitable for large projects:**
  - Development of complex applications
  - Requires the work of several people
  - Involves collaboration across multiple teams

- **In such cases, additional phases are necessary.**

### Traditional Approach: Six Phases in the Software Lifecycle

1. **Pre-analysis Phase:** Feasibility and opportunity study.
2. **Requirements Analysis and Specification Phase:**
   - **Analysis:** Understanding the client’s needs.
   - **Specification:** Establishing a clear description of what the software must do (detailed functionalities, quality requirements, interface).
   - Clarifying the specifications (resolving ambiguities and contradictions) by listing functional and non-functional requirements.
3. **Design Phase:** Architectural and detailed design.
4. **Implementation Phase:** Programming.
5. **Testing Phase:** Validation and verification.
6. **Maintenance Phase:** Configuration management and integration.

### 1. Pre-analysis Phase (Feasibility Study)

- **Development Approach:** This phase aims to answer the question: Why should this software be developed, and what are the needs?
- **Other Questions Addressed:**
  - Why is the software needed?
  - Are there better alternatives?
  - Will the software be satisfactory for users?
  - Is there a market for the software?
  - What resources are needed to develop the software (budget, personnel, hardware)?
- **Outcome:** The answer is either yes or no:
  - Yes: The decision is made to develop the software.
  - No: The project is abandoned.
- **Purpose:** To determine if the proposed development is worth implementing, considering the expectations and development difficulty (Market study: determine if there is a potential market for the product).

### 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification (1/4)

- **Requirements Analysis:**
  - Understand the client's needs and determine the functionalities the software must have.
  - Requirements Gathering: Obtain the user’s requirements for the software.
  - Domain Analysis: Identify repetitive tasks and structures within the problem.
  - Provided by the client (domain expert, future user).

- **Requirements Specification:**
  - Establish a clear description of what the software must do (detailed functionalities, quality requirements, interface, etc.).
  - Clarify the specifications (resolving ambiguities and contradictions) by listing functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Focus:** This phase emphasizes investigating the problem and needs rather than seeking a solution.

### 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification (2/4)

- **Goal:** Avoid developing inadequate software. This phase should answer the question "What to do?" by understanding the client's needs and defining the specific functions the software must perform.
- **Initial Description:** Establish a first description of the future system.
- **Example:** Developing payroll software for a company.
  - The specification phase will answer questions such as:
    - Are employees recorded on tape or disk?
    - What is the format of each file record?
    - What is the format of the outputs?
    - Etc.

### 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification (3/4)

- **Input:** Data provided by domain experts and future users.
- **Methods:**
  - Establish a dialogue with domain experts (often not IT specialists).
  - Use cognitive methods: interviews, questionnaires, observations of existing systems, studies of similar situations.
  - Object-Oriented Approach: UML modeling involves different types of diagrams corresponding to various specification activities.
  - Extensive use of use case diagrams, descriptive sheets of use cases, and additional diagrams.
- **Approach:**
  - To establish the requirements (specifications), study the application domain:
    - The current state of the future system's environment.
    - The system's role.
    - Available and required resources.
    - Usage constraints.
    - Expected performance, etc.
  - Produce a description of what the system must do without specifying how it does it: the "what" but not the "how."

### 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification (4/4)

- **Link:**
  - This activity should be conducted in conjunction with feasibility studies and planning.
  - It should continue throughout the development process.
- **Result:**
  - The software requirements specification (SRS) document.
  - Documents describing:
    - The environment of the future system.
    - Its role.
    - Its usage (preliminary user manual).
    - If necessary, the division between hardware and software.
  - Analysis Model: Use case diagrams, additional diagrams, and documentation.
- **Duration:** This phase can continue throughout the software lifecycle (evolutionary maintenance).

### 3. High-Level and Detailed Design

- **Design Purpose:** The design phase involves creating a concrete solution that fulfills the specifications and conceptually addresses the needs rather than just implementing the solution.
  - It determines how the software will provide the required functionalities.
    - **Architectural Description:** Components (with interfaces and functionalities).
    - **Functionality Realization:** Through components (algorithms, data organization).
    - **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, security.

### Two Levels of Design

- **High-Level Design (General or Preliminary):**
  - **Architectural Design:** Determine the general structure of the system.
    - Fundamental choices of software architecture, modules.
  - **Interface Design:** Determine how different parts (components or modules) of the system interact with each other, potentially linked to hardware architecture.

- **Detailed Design:**
  - Precise description of each module.
  - **Algorithms Implementation:** Determine the algorithms for different parts of the system.
  - **Error Handling:** Processes performed in case of errors.

### Context and Goals

- **Context:** Given a specification (what the product must do).
- **Goal:**
  - Answer the question "how": how to realize the software defined by the specifications.
  - Define the software architecture by establishing a description very close to the system to be realized (how it is structured to do what it must do).
  - **Design Documentation:** Global and detailed design document.
  - **Entity Allocation:** Distribute the identified entities (or functions) in the specifications over a hardware and software architecture.
  - **Decomposition:** Break down the software into simpler components, defined by their interfaces and functions (the services they provide).
  - **Algorithm Choices:** Select appropriate algorithms.
  - **Specification Validation:** Demonstrate that the specification is correctly described.

### Consistency and Focus

- **Consistency:** Ensure coherence between description, specification, and design.
- **Focus:** On behavior and properties.
- **Input:** Use the results from the requirements analysis.
- **Modeling:** Use class, object, and package diagrams.

### Object-Oriented Approach: UML

- **UML Modeling:** Implements different types of diagrams corresponding to various activities.
  - **Requirements Expression:** Derived from the analysis phase.
    - Mainly use cases, descriptive sheets, and some diagrams.
  - **Entity Identification:** Analysis class diagrams: classes, associations, attributes, operations.
  - **Behavior Description:** Interaction, sequence, activity, state-transition diagrams, etc.

---

### 4. Implementation: Programming

- **Goal:** Implement the designed solution.
  - Develop, based on the detailed design, a set of programs or program components.
  - Translate the concepts from the model into a programming language.
- **Manual Process:** The implementation process is manual.
- **Development Environment Choices:** 
  - Selection of the development environment, programming language(s), and development standards.
- **Inputs:**
  - Detailed design + constraints of the programming environment.
- **Outputs:**
  - **Documents Describing:**
    - Source code of each module.
    - Compilation directives, linking instructions, etc.
    - Implementation documentation.

### 5. Testing: Validation and Verification

- **Objectives:**
  - **Validation:**
    - Ensure that the client's needs are met (at the specification level, in the final product, etc.).
  - **Verification:**
    - Ensure that the software meets its specification.
- **Purpose of this Activity:**
  - Ensure that the produced system meets the needs and specifications.
    - Are we specifying the right system? That is, a system that meets user expectations and respects their environmental constraints?
  - This mainly involves reviews and inspections of specifications or manuals and rapid prototyping.
- **Inputs:**
  - Documents produced from all previous stages.

### Configuration Management, Integration, and Maintenance

- **Configuration Management and Integration**
  - **Objective:** Obtain all or part of the executable system.
  - Integration aims to create one or more executable systems from components. Possible choices correspond to system variations.
  - **Input:** Components + configuration descriptions.
  - **Methods:** Manage system components, their evolution, updates, and integration.
  - **Result:** Documents describing: 
    - Executables
    - Configurations
  
- **Maintenance Phase**
  - Begins once the software is operational.
  - Three types of maintenance:
    - **Corrective Maintenance:** Identifies and corrects errors found after delivery.
    - **Adaptive Maintenance:** Adapts the software to an evolving environment (software and hardware).
      - For example, adapting software to a new version of an operating system.
    - **Perfective Maintenance:** Extends the software to include new capabilities, functions, etc.

### Work Distribution
- In a "well-conducted" project, efforts are distributed as follows:
  - 40% = Analysis (20%) and Design (20%)
  - 15 to 20% = Programming
  - 40% = Validation and Verification

### Disadvantages of a Non-Iterative Cycle and Importance of an Iterative Cycle

- **Disadvantages of a Non-Iterative Cycle:**
  - A non-iterative life cycle is overly simplistic for several reasons:
    - As the project progresses, mastery increases, leading to a tendency to revisit certain choices made when the project was less well-defined.
    - During software specification, some considerations regarding implementation may be useful. Without them, certain aspects of the specifications could be unrealistic (this involves partial anticipation of a future phase).
    - Some specifications (i.e., certain aspects of the specifications) may change during the project because the client changes their mind (agility is more suitable).

An iterative cycle, on the other hand, allows for flexibility and adaptation as the project evolves. It acknowledges that requirements may change, and it accommodates this through periodic reviews and adjustments. This iterative approach fosters collaboration, continuous improvement, and ultimately leads to a more successful and satisfying outcome for all stakeholders involved.
