### Visitor
**Visitor** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. With this pattern, you can add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. Here's how it works:
- **Elements** (objects) accept visitors.
- **Visitor** objects contain the operations to be performed on elements.
- When a visitor is accepted by an element, the element calls the appropriate method on the visitor.

**Use Cases**:
- When you have a complex object structure with many different types of objects and you want to perform operations across these objects.
- When you need to add operations without modifying the object structure.

### Observer
**Observer** is a behavioral design pattern in which an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems.

**Use Cases**:
- When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don’t know how many objects need to be changed.
- When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who those objects are.

### Strategy
**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

**Use Cases**:
- When you need to use different variations of an algorithm.
- When you want to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.

### Abstract Factory
**Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It involves an interface responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.

**Use Cases**:
- When a system should be independent of how its products are created.
- When a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.

### Factory Method
**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern delegates the creation of objects to a derived class.

**Use Cases**:
- When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand.
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.

### Adapter
**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing a class to work with a class it doesn't normally have the ability to work with.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn’t match the one you need.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes with incompatible interfaces.

### Composite
**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows individual objects and compositions of objects to be treated uniformly.

**Use Cases**:
- When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- When you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

### Examples:

**Visitor**:
```python
class Visitor:
    def visit(self, element):
        pass

class ConcreteVisitor(Visitor):
    def visit(self, element):
        print(f"Visiting {element}")

class Element:
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit(self)

class ConcreteElement(Element):
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit(self)
```

**Observer**:
```python
class Observer:
    def update(self, state):
        pass

class ConcreteObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, state):
        print(f"Observer state updated to {state}")

class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []
        self._state = None

    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(self._state)

    def set_state(self, state):
        self._state = state
        self.notify()
```

**Strategy**:
```python
class Strategy:
    def execute(self):
        pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def execute(self):
        print("Strategy A execution")

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def execute(self):
        print("Strategy B execution")

class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy: Strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy: Strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def execute_strategy(self):
        self._strategy.execute()
```

**Abstract Factory**:
```python
class AbstractFactory:
    def create_product_a(self):
        pass

    def create_product_b(self):
        pass

class ConcreteFactory1(AbstractFactory):
    def create_product_a(self):
        return ProductA1()

    def create_product_b(self):
        return ProductB1()

class ProductA1:
    pass

class ProductB1:
    pass

# Client code
factory = ConcreteFactory1()
product_a = factory.create_product_a()
product_b = factory.create_product_b()
```

**Factory Method**:
```python
class Creator:
    def factory_method(self):
        pass

    def some_operation(self):
        product = self.factory_method()
        print(f"Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {product}")

class ConcreteCreator(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct()

class ConcreteProduct:
    def __str__(self):
        return "ConcreteProduct"

# Client code
creator = ConcreteCreator()
creator.some_operation()
```

**Adapter**:
```python
class Target:
    def request(self):
        pass

class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return "Adaptee's specific request"

class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee: Adaptee):
        self._adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        return self._adaptee.specific_request()

# Client code
adaptee = Adaptee()
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
print(adapter.request())
```

**Composite**:
```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class Leaf(Component):
    def operation(self):
        print("Leaf operation")

class Composite(Component):
    def __init__(self):
        self._children = []

    def add(self, component: Component):
        self._children.append(component)

    def remove(self, component: Component):
        self._children.remove(component)

    def operation(self):
        print("Composite operation")
        for child in self._children:
            child.operation()

# Client code
leaf1 = Leaf()
leaf2 = Leaf()
composite = Composite()
composite.add(leaf1)
composite.add(leaf2)
composite.operation()
```

These detailed explanations and code examples should provide a clearer understanding of each design pattern.
