### 3. Associations particulières : composition et agrégation

#### a) Composition

- Indicates that a composite object is made up of one or more component objects.
- The lifecycle of the components is dependent on that of the composite: if the composite is destroyed, then the component is also destroyed.
- The component cannot simultaneously belong to multiple composites (multiplicity 1 or 0..1 on the composite side).
- This is a very strong relationship.

**Example 1:**

- **University** and **Room**
  - A university is composed of one to many rooms.
  - A room belongs to one and only one university.

- **Book** and **Chapter**
  - A chapter only makes sense as part of a book.
  - It cannot exist in two different books, and if the book no longer exists, the chapters do not either.

#### b) Agrégation

- Indicates that an object A (aggregate) possesses another object B (component).
- Unlike composition, object B can exist independently of object A.
- The deletion of object A does not lead to the deletion of object B.
- Object A is both the possessor and the user of object B.
- The component can simultaneously belong to multiple aggregates.

**Example 2:**

- **Person** and **University**
  - A person can study at none to several universities.
  - A university can accommodate one to many persons.

### Computer Composition Overview

An **ordinateur** consists of one or more **écrans**, a **boîtier**, an optional **souris**, and a **clavier**. The **boîtier** houses a **châssis métallique**, a **carte mère**, multiple **barrettes de mémoire** (RAM, ROM, and cache), an optional **ventilateur**, various **supports de stockage** (disquette, disque dur, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM...), and **cartes périphériques** (sound, network, graphics). Every **ordinateur** always includes at least one **lecteur de disquette** or a **disque dur**.

### 5. Concrete and Abstract Classes (Polymorphism)

- A concrete class has instances and represents a complete object model (all attributes and methods are fully described).
- Conversely, an abstract class cannot have direct instances because it does not provide a complete description. Its purpose is to have concrete subclasses and to factorize attributes and methods to its subclasses.
- An abstract class typically has methods common to subclasses that are only declared (without internal coding).
- A method introduced in a class with only its signature and no code is called an abstract method.
- Abstract methods are represented with the class or method name in italics.

#### Example 1:

- In the following representation, we consider that men, women, and dogs were instanciable objects, generalized respectively by the classes mammal and human, and mammal.
- According to this representation, there cannot exist mammals that are neither men, women, nor dogs, nor humans that are neither men nor women.

- Above, the class Forme is abstract since it consists of the abstract method affiche(). This method is specified as abstract because it is impossible to describe a specific shape without knowing the exact form.
- Only with a concrete class like Cercle are we capable of drawing the corresponding shape.

### 6. Realization Relationship and Interface Concept

- An interface is not a class; it is a list of operations providing a coherent service. The goal is to greatly reduce coupling between two classes.
- An interface, like an abstract class but without attributes, cannot be used to create an object.
- It expresses know-how, a contract to be respected by classes that "realize" this interface, in the form of a list of operation declarations without their definition.
- It only has public abstract methods (or in other words, undefined methods).
- Generalization can be used between interfaces.
- Graphically, realization is represented by a dashed line ending with a triangular arrow, sometimes stereotyped as "realize."

The realization relationship is actually represented as an inheritance relationship with a dashed line.
- It is a form of partial inheritance: behavioral inheritance but not structural.
- A class that realizes (implements) an interface is obliged to define the methods described by the interface, just like a concrete class defining the abstract methods inherited from its abstract parent class.
- A class can realize multiple interfaces, and an interface can be realized by multiple classes (very common case).
- This is indeed the interest of interfaces; one or more classes will use only the necessary functionalities of the classes that realize an interface by passing through said interface.
