### II. Class Relationships

#### 1. Dependency Relationship

- Dependency is the weakest form of relationship between classes.
- It signifies that one class uses the other.
- Represented by a dashed line, indicating the dependency, often stereotyped ("use") to better explain the semantic link between elements in the model.

#### Example

![Dependency Relationship Example](Pasted%20image%2020240525003108.png)

#### 2. Associations

- Unlike dependency, where one class simply uses objects of another class, association means that a class will contain a reference (or pointer) to the object of the associated class in the form of an attribute.
- This relationship is stronger, indicating that a class is in a relationship with another for a certain period.
- Represented by a simple continuous line connecting the two classes. The fact that two instances are thus linked allows navigation from one instance to the other, and vice versa (each class has an attribute that refers to the other class).

#### a) Name of the Association

![Association Example](Pasted%20image%2020240525003202.png)

#### b) Roles

- The ends of the association are called roles.
- The role played by a class in relation to an association can be specified on the association.
- Each end of an association can be named. This name is called a role and indicates how the object is seen from the other side of the association.
- When an object A is linked to another object B by an association, this often results in an additional attribute in A that will bear the name of role B (and vice versa).

#### c) Cardinality (or Multiplicity)

- Indicates the number of instances of a class that are in relation to the class at the other end of the association.
- In the absence of specification, the cardinality is 1.
- Example: In a class, there is 1 teacher and several students.
- If specified as "*", this translates to a multiplicity of 0..*.

#### d) Navigability

- Navigability indicates whether the association works unidirectionally or bidirectionally.
- Associations have bidirectional navigation by default, which assumes that each class has an attribute that refers to the other class in the association.
- It is more common to need unidirectional navigability. In this case, only one class has an attribute that refers to the other class.
- A unidirectional relationship can be represented in 3 different ways.

#### e) Reflexive (or Recursive) Association

- Links a class to itself.

#### f) Constraints and Associations

Other specific properties (constraints) are proposed in UML to specify the semantics of an association. They allow the restriction of the number of instances targeted. They can be expressed within `{}` in natural language or OCL (Object Constraint Language).
- They are of two types: Predefined (Standard UML) or non-predefined.
- Below is an example of some predefined constraints.

**Constraint of Sorting Order of an Association**

- For an association with multiplicity greater than 1, the links can be:
  - Unordered (default value)
  - Ordered or sorted when at the implementation level (sorted based on an internal value).
  - Example: For a given company, people will be recorded in an order corresponding to one of the attributes of `Person`.

**Example 2: Constraint on an Association**

- An object of the class `Person` is associated with an object of the class `Date`. The constraint `{frozen}` indicates that this association can no longer be modified once instantiated.

### Constraints {subset} and {inclusion}

**Exclusion Constraints on Association {xor}**

- This type of constraint allows modeling the case where, for a given instance of a class, only one association among several possible can be valid at any given time.

#### g) Association qualifiée (Qualification)

- An association qualifiée possesses a qualifier that serves to select an object (or multiple objects) from a larger set of objects.
- The addition of a qualifier (also called a key or index) restricts the cardinality of an association. It is composed of one or more attributes that allow targeting specific objects.
- This translates to a search using a key, for example, searching for objects in an ArrayList.

#### h) Association n-aire

- An association n-aire links more than 2 classes together.
- It is represented by a diamond with a line going to each class.

**Example 1**

![N-ary Association Example](Pasted%20image%2020240525010814.png)

**Important to Remember:**

- The n-ary association is imprecise, difficult to interpret, and often a source of error, so it is rarely used.
- Most of the time, we use it only to sketch the modeling at the beginning of the project. It is quickly replaced by a set of binary associations to remove any ambiguity.

**Example 2:**

It is better to limit the use of n-ary associations. See the following example of conversions:

#### i) Classe d’association (Classe associative)

- An association can bring new information (attributes and methods) that do not belong to any of the two classes it connects and that are specific to the association.
- These new pieces of information can be represented by a new class attached to the association via a dashed line (without multiplicity).
- An association can be materialized by a class under the following circumstances:
  - If the association carries attributes and/or operations.
  - If the association materializes as a concrete object in the real world.
  - If the association has many-to-many multiplicity (M..N).

![Association Class Example](Pasted%20image%2020240525011040.png)

**Example 1:**

- A student can complete several assignments.
- An assignment is completed by one or more students.
- For each assignment completed by each student, a grade is assigned.

![Association Class Example 1](Pasted%20image%2020240525011106.png)

**Example 2:**

- When a person uses a phone, it is necessary to measure the duration of the call and know when it occurs to charge it accordingly.
- Two attributes, duration and billing period, are added, which do not belong to either the `Person` class or the `Phone` class. These two attributes are placed in a new class (`Call`) attached to the association.
