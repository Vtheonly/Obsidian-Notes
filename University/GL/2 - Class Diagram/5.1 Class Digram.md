### 1. Class Diagrams (DCL)

In software engineering, **Class Diagrams (DCL)** are essential tools used in both the analysis and design phases of software development. Their usage varies depending on the stage of the development process.

#### 1.1. Analysis Phase
During the **analysis phase**, the DCL represents the entities and information manipulated by users. This is a crucial step to understand the needs and interactions within the system to be designed.

#### 1.2. Design Phase
In the **design phase**, the DCL depicts the object structure of object-oriented development. It highlights **classes**, their **attributes**, **methods**, and **associations** between them.

### 2. Role and Definition of DCL

The DCL is a pivotal element of **UML modeling**, providing a static representation of the system to be developed. It primarily focuses on two fundamental concepts:

#### 2.1. Classes
These define the entities of the system, with their attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors). Each class is responsible for its own data and processing, as well as interactions with other classes.

#### 2.2. Associations
These represent relationships between classes, forming the structure of the system. Associations are crucial in object-oriented modeling, and understanding them is imperative for designing a robust system.

### 3. Class Description

A **class** describes a group of objects sharing common properties, similar behaviors, and shared semantics. It serves as a blueprint from which objects are created, defining the attributes and functionalities of these objects.

### 4. Example of OO Analysis

Let's take the example of the company "DETEX," which sells shirts through a catalog. We can analyze the characteristics of a shirt, such as its identifier, barcode, color, size, price, description, and quantity in stock.

### 5. Class Representation

A **class** is typically represented by a rectangle divided into three compartments:

1. **Class Name**: Identifies the type of instantiated object, starting with a capital letter.
2. **Attributes**: Lists the properties of the class.
3. **Operations (Methods)**: Indicates the behaviors associated with the class.

### 6. Levels of Detail

The representation of a class can vary depending on the modeling needs. Details such as method and attribute visibility, types, method signatures, etc., can be included.

### 7. Examples

- **Clock Class**:
  - Attributes: hours (int), minutes (int)
  - Methods: set(), display()

- **MP3Player Class**:
  - Attributes: volume (int), selection (int)
  - Methods: powerOn(), powerOff(), select(), fastForward(), rewind(), changeVolume(), nextTrack(), previousTrack()

Depending on the modeling objectives, the representation of a class can be more or less exhaustive, covering various aspects such as visibility, types, constraints, etc.

### I. Representation of Classes

Depending on the modeling objectives, the representation of a class can be more or less exhaustive. We can detail the class by indicating:

1. **Visibility (Encapsulation) of Methods and Attributes**    
2. **Type of Each Attribute**
3. **Signature of Each Method**
4. **Return Type of Each Method**
5. **Direction of Method Parameters**
6. **Default Values of Attributes and Method Parameters**
7. **Class Attributes and Methods (or Static Attributes and Methods)**
8. **Constraints**
9. **Computed Attributes (Derived)**
10. **Multiplicity (or Cardinality)**
11. **Constructors and Destructors**
12. **Enumerations**
13. **Class Templates**

Each of these aspects contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the class and its behavior within the system being modeled.

### 1. Visibility (Encapsulation) of Methods and Attributes
   - **Public**: Non-encapsulated element visible to all.
   - **Private**: Encapsulated element visible only within the class.
   - **Protected**: Encapsulated element visible within the class and its subclasses.
   - **Package**: Encapsulated element visible within classes of the same package.
   Symbol to place before the attribute or method:
   - `+` for public
   - `-` for private
   - `#` for protected
   - `~` for package
### 2. Le type de chaque attribut.
### 3. La signature de chaque méthode.
### 4. Le type de valeur retournée par chaque méthode.

### 5. Direction of Method Parameters

Before the parameter name, it is possible to indicate with a keyword (in, out, inout) the direction in which it is transmitted.

- **in**: The value of the parameter is transmitted upon the method call (by the caller of the method) and cannot be modified (this is the default behavior if no direction is specified).
- **out**: The final value of the parameter is transmitted upon the method call return (to the caller of the method).
- **inout**: The value of the parameter is transmitted both upon the method call and upon the return.

#### Examples:

1. Consider the method of the Clock class:
   ```
   setTime(hours: int, minutes: int): void
   ```
   The caller of the method wants to assign the hours and minutes attributes with values provided.
   The direction of the parameters would be **in**:
   ```
   setTime(in hours: int, in minutes: int): void
   ```

2. Consider another method of the Clock class:
   ```
   getTime(hours: int, minutes: int): void
   ```
   The caller of the method wants to retrieve the values of the hours and minutes attributes.
   The direction of the parameters would be **out**:
   ```
   getTime(out hours: int, out minutes: int): void
   ```

As a method can only return one value, and in this case, we need to know two values (hours and minutes), the return is done through the arguments (using references or pointers in C++).


### 6. Default Values

#### Clock

- **hours**: int = 0
- **minutes**: int = 0

**Methods:**
+ **setTime**(in hours: int = 0, in minutes: int =0): void
+ **display**(): void
+ **getTime**(out hours: int, out minutes: int): void

### 7. Class Attributes and Methods

Class attributes and methods (or static attributes and methods) allow having common information shared among all instantiated objects. A class can contain attributes and methods unique to it, which can be accessed without necessarily instantiating objects. A class attribute or method is represented by an underlined name.

#### Example: Gasoil Class

**Gasoil**
- **quantity**: double {quantity<100}
- **pricePerLitre**: double = 1.23
+ **setQuantity**(quantity: double): void
+ **getQuantity**(): double {query}
+ **setPrice**(perLitre: double): void

The attribute **pricePerLitre** belongs to the Gasoil class; it is not part of the instantiated objects, but each individual object can access it. The method **setPrice()** allows modifying the value of the class attribute **pricePerLitre** (this is the only method allowed to do so).

![[Pasted image 20240525001017.png]]


### 8. Constraints

- A constraint is a condition written between curly braces. It can be expressed in:
  - Natural language (textual description)
  - Formal language (C++, Java, OCL, etc.).

#### Example: Gasoil Class (Seen Previously)

**Gasoil**
- **quantity**: double {quantity < 100}
- **pricePerLitre**: double = 1.23
+ **setQuantity**(quantity: double): void
+ **getQuantity**(): double {query}
+ **fixePrix**(perLitre: double): void

- The quantity of diesel provided by the pump must be less than 100 liters.
- Constant method (read-only)


![[Pasted image 20240525000924.png]]
### 9. Computed Attributes (Derived)

- A computed attribute is based on other attributes (using a function).
- It has a name preceded by the symbol "/" and followed by a constraint to calculate it.

#### Computed Attributes

**Circle**

- **mutator** associated with the **quantity** attribute
- **accessor** associated with the **quantity** attribute

#### Example: Gasoil Class (Extended with prixDuPlein Attribute)

**Gasoil**
- **quantity**: double {quantity < 100}
- **pricePerLitre**: double = 1.23
- **prixDuPlein**: double {prixDuPlein = quantity * pricePerLitre}
+ **setQuantity**(quantity: double): void
+ **getQuantity**(): double {query}
+ **fixePrix**(perLitre: double): void

- **X**: int = 0
- **Y**: int = 0
- **radius**: unsigned int
- **diameter**: unsigned int {diameter = 2 * radius}

Mutators and accessors are special methods that allow respectively modifying or consulting the content of a specific attribute in the class. In Java, we often use the prefixes `setXxx()` and `getXxx()`, while for C++, the signature is at the discretion of the developer.

### 10. Multiplicity (or Cardinality) of Class

- It indicates the number of values that the attribute can contain.
- The attribute is often an array of values, static or dynamic.
- It is noted in square brackets after the attribute type.

#### Example: Weather Station

**WeatherReading**
- **temperature**: int[100]
+ **setTemperature**(quantity: double): void
+ **getTemperature**(): double {query}

**WeatherReading**
- **temperature**: int[*]
+ **setTemperature**(quantity: double): void
+ **getTemperature**(): double {query}

- The attribute **temperature** contains 100 int values.
- Dynamic array of any capacity.
![[Pasted image 20240525002404.png]]
### 11. Constructors and Destructors

- Stereotypes can be used to identify specific operations such as constructors (stereotype "create") and destructors (stereotype "destroy").

#### Example: Notes Class

**Notes**
- **count**: unsigned = 0
- **size**: unsigned
+ **create** Notes(quantity: unsigned = 10)
+ **addNote**(note: double): void
+ **average**(): double {query}
+ **max**(): double {query}
+ **destroy** ~Notes()

- **notes**: double[*]

Dynamic array of any capacity.


![[Pasted image 20240525002420.png]]
### 12. Enumerations

- An enumeration is a type with a finite and arbitrary number of possible values, custom-built by the developer to type specific variables, such as representing days of the week or months of the year.

#### Representation:

In UML, an enumeration is not defined by a class but by a stereotyped "enumeration" classifier. It is a data type with a name used to enumerate a set of literals corresponding to all possible values that an expression of this type can take.

**Enumeration:**
```
« enumeration »
Weekday
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
```
![[Pasted image 20240525002520.png]]
### 13. Class Templates (Generic Types)

- They are an advanced feature of object-oriented programming.
- A template is a parameterized class that allows choosing the type of attributes as needed based on the specified parameter, indicated in the upper right corner in a rectangle with dashed lines.

#### Example: Vector Class

**Type: double**

**Vector**
- **array**: double[*]
+ **push_back**(value: double): void
+ **pop_back**(): double
+ **size**(): int

**Vector**
- **array**: Type[*]
+ **push_back**(value: Type): void
+ **pop_back**(): Type
+ **size**(): int

Parameterized class.

Choosing the type to represent a dynamic array of real numbers.
