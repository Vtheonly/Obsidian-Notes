**1. Considering the nuances of "Généralisation de Cas," which statement best captures its essence?**
   - [ ] A) It represents a sequential flow between use cases.
   - [ ] B)  It defines an optional behavior that can be added to a use case.
   - [ ] C) It establishes an "is-a-kind-of" relationship where a specific use case inherits from a more general one.
   - [ ] D) It indicates that one use case must always execute another use case.

**2. In the context of "Inclusion," the phrase "A inclut B" signifies that:**
   - [ ] A) B is optional and may or may not execute as part of A.
   - [ ] B) B is an extension point that can be triggered by A under certain conditions.
   - [ ] C) A is a specific type of B.
   - [ ] D) B is a mandatory component or sub-step of A.

**3. The primary purpose of "Inclusion" is to:**
   - [ ] A) Add optional behaviors to existing use cases.
   - [ ] B)  Factor out common functionality to simplify and reuse across multiple use cases.
   - [ ] C) Define specialized subtypes of a general use case.
   - [ ] D)  Model alternative flows within a use case.

**4.   "Extension" differs from "Inclusion" in that "Extension" represents:**
   - [ ] A) A mandatory sub-flow.
   - [ ] B)  A base use case that is inherited by other use cases.
   - [ ] C)  An optional or conditional behavior that enhances a base use case.
   - [ ] D)  A simplification of a complex use case.

**5. An "extension point" in the context of "Extension" is: **
   - [ ] A) The starting point of the base use case.
   - [ ] B) The end point of the extending use case.
   - [ ] C)  A specific location within the base use case where the extension can occur.
   - [ ] D)  A general condition that must be met before the extension can occur.

**6.   If Use Case X "étend" Use Case Y, when is Use Case X executed?**
   - [ ] A) Always before Use Case Y.
   - [ ] B)  Always after Use Case Y.
   - [ ] C)  Only if a specific condition is met at a defined extension point in Use Case Y.
   - [ ] D)  Intermittently throughout the execution of Use Case Y.

**7.   Which of the following best describes the relationship between a base use case and an extending use case?**
   - [ ] A) The base use case cannot exist without the extending use case.
   - [ ] B)  The base use case is a specific type of the extending use case.
   - [ ] C) The extending use case enhances the base use case with optional or conditional behavior.
   - [ ] D) The extending use case replaces the base use case under certain conditions.

**8. In the example provided, "Apply Discount" extending "Place Order" implies:**
   - [ ] A) Applying a discount is mandatory for every order.
   - [ ] B)  Applying a discount is a specialized type of placing an order.
   - [ ] C)  Applying a discount is a possible, but not required, addition to the "Place Order" use case.
   - [ ] D)  "Place Order" cannot be completed without applying a discount.

**9. How does "Généralisation de Cas" contribute to the organization of use cases?**
   - [ ] A) It creates modularity by breaking down complex use cases into smaller, reusable components.
   - [ ] B)  It allows for the addition of optional features without modifying the core use cases.
   - [ ] C)  It establishes a hierarchy of use cases, promoting reusability and reducing redundancy.
   - [ ] D)  It defines the sequence in which use cases must be executed.

**10. The arrow notation "B étend A" means:**
    - [ ] A)  A includes B as a mandatory step.
    - [ ] B)  B is a generalization of A.
    - [ ] C)  A is an optional extension of B.
    - [ ] D)  B is an optional extension of A.

**11. Considering both "Inclusion" and "Extension," which statement is most accurate?**
    - [ ] A) Both are used for mandatory behavior, but in different contexts.
    - [ ] B) Both are used for optional behavior, but with different levels of conditionality.
    - [ ] C) "Inclusion" adds required behavior, while "Extension" adds optional behavior.
    - [ ] D) "Inclusion" refines use cases through specialization, while "Extension" combines use cases.

**12. A complex use case involving several optional sub-flows and alternative scenarios would benefit MOST from the use of:**
    - [ ] A)  "Généralisation de Cas" only.
    - [ ] B)  "Inclusion" and "Extension" in combination.
    - [ ] C)  "Inclusion" only.
    - [ ] D)  "Extension" only.

**13.   In a system modeling user interactions, "Authenticate User" is frequently a good candidate for:**
    - [ ] A) An extending use case.
    - [ ] B)  A generalized use case.
    - [ ] C) An included use case.
    - [ ] D)  An independent use case with no relationships.

**14. Misusing "Inclusion" could lead to:**
    - [ ] A)   Use cases that are too simplistic and lack detail.
    - [ ] B)  Use cases that are overly complex and difficult to understand.
    - [ ] C)   Use cases that are too general and lack specific behavior.
    - [ ] D)   Use cases that have too many optional paths.

**15.   The arrow direction in the notation (e.g., "A inclut B" or "B étend A") indicates: **
    - [ ] A)  The flow of data between use cases.
    - [ ] B)  The sequence of execution between use cases.
    - [ ] C) The dependency relationship and which use case incorporates or extends the other.
    - [ ] D) The user role that initiates the use case.
