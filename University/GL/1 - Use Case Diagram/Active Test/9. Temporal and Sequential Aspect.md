## Quiz: Temporal and Sequential Aspects

### Instructions:

Each question has multiple options. Select the most appropriate answer(s). Answers are provided at the end of the file.

---

### 1. What does the temporal aspect primarily focus on?

- [ ]  The time-related constraints of events.
- [ ]  The order of actions within a system.
- [ ]  The duration of events in a process.
- [ ]  The dependencies between events based on time.

---

### 2. The sequential aspect is most relevant in which of the following scenarios?

- [ ]  A real-time monitoring system with strict time constraints.
- [ ]  A business workflow where each step depends on the previous one.
- [ ]  A distributed system where the timing of events varies.
- [ ]  An algorithm where steps must execute in a specific order.

---

### 3. Which of the following best illustrates the intersection of temporal and sequential aspects?

- [ ]  A sequence of steps in a manufacturing process.
- [ ]  A schedule of buses arriving at a station.
- [ ]  A software process that executes actions in a specific order, each with a set duration.
- [ ]  A recipe with steps listed without considering preparation time.

---

### 4. In a banking system, modeling the sequence of steps within a transaction corresponds to:

- [ ]  Temporal aspects.
- [ ]  Sequential aspects.
- [ ]  Both temporal and sequential aspects.
- [ ]  Neither temporal nor sequential aspects.
