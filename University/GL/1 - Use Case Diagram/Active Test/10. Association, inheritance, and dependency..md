### 1. What does an association relationship represent in a class diagram?

- [ ]  A "uses-a" relationship between classes.
- [ ]  A structural relationship between instances of classes.
- [ ]  A specialization of one class by another.
- [ ]  A dependency that lasts only during method execution.

---

### 2. Which notation represents an inheritance relationship in a class diagram?

- [ ]  A dashed arrow pointing from a dependent class to the class it depends on.
- [ ]  A solid line connecting two classes with multiplicity indicators.
- [ ]  An arrow pointing from the subclass to the superclass.
- [ ]  A double-headed arrow between two classes.

---

### 3. In what scenario would you use an inheritance relationship?

- [ ]  When two classes share a common method but differ in their implementation details.
- [ ]  When one class depends on the behavior of another for temporary actions.
- [ ]  When a class represents a more specialized version of another class.
- [ ]  When one class needs to own an instance of another class.

### 4. Which of the following correctly describes a dependency relationship?

- [ ]  It is a transient relationship where one class relies on another class.
- [ ]  It is a permanent relationship showing class hierarchy.
- [ ]  It is depicted with a dashed arrow pointing from the dependent class to the other class.
- [ ]  It represents a direct ownership between two classes.

---

### 5. Multiplicity in an association relationship specifies:

- [ ]  The number of instances of one class that can be associated with an instance of another class.
- [ ]  How often a dependency is established during runtime.
- [ ]  The type of inheritance used between two classes.
- [ ]  The temporal duration of the relationship.

### 6. Which relationship would best model the connection between `Student` and `Course` in a university system?

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  None

---

### 7. What is the main advantage of using inheritance in class diagrams?

- [ ]  Simplifies relationships by making them transient.
- [ ]  Enables polymorphism and code reuse.
- [ ]  Establishes a weak relationship between unrelated classes.
- [ ]  Prevents any changes in the subclass from affecting the superclass.

---

### 8. Which of the following is **NOT** true about dependency?

- [ ]  It is a loosely coupled relationship.
- [ ]  It is depicted with a dashed arrow.
- [ ]  It always implies ownership between classes.
- [ ]  It is a transient relationship.

---

### 9. In a library system, which relationship would best model the connection between `Book` and `LibraryMember`?

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  None

---

### 10. Which relationship type should be used when a class `Order` relies on a class `Product` as a parameter for one of its methods?

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  None

---

### 11. How is polymorphism enabled through inheritance?

- [ ]  By allowing a subclass to override methods of its superclass.
- [ ]  By creating a transient dependency between unrelated classes.
- [ ]  By ensuring subclasses cannot modify the behavior of the superclass.
- [ ]  By associating multiple classes with the same parent class.

### 12. In an e-commerce application, the relationship between `Customer` and `ShoppingCart` is most likely:

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  None

---

### 13. Which relationship is primarily used to show a hierarchical structure in a class diagram?

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  Multiplicity

---

### 14. Which relationship would be used to model a "has-a" relationship in object-oriented design?

- [ ]  Association
- [ ]  Dependency
- [ ]  Inheritance
- [ ]  None

---

### 15. What is the key difference between association and dependency?

- [ ]  Association is more transient, while dependency is permanent.
- [ ]  Dependency focuses on weak relationships, while association indicates ownership or collaboration.
- [ ]  Association represents structural relationships, while dependency is a "uses-a" relationship.
- [ ]  Dependency and association are interchangeable in class diagrams.
