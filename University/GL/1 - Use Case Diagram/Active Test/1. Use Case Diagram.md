- [ ] B)  Focusing on the system's internal processes.
- [x] C)  Understanding the actors' goals and how the system helps them achieve them.
- [ ] D) Using technical jargon to ensure precision.


### 7.  Which of these is NOT a key aspect of a Use Case?

- [ ] A) Describes a customer's need.
- [ ] B)  Represents a function of the future system.
- [x] C) Details the specific programming language used for implementation.

- [ ] B) To define the scope of the system.
- [ ] C) To specify the system's user interface design.
- [ ] D) To serve as a basis for testing.


### 11. How should temporal aspects (e.g., time constraints) be handled in Use Case modeling?

- [ ] A) They should be explicitly included in the Use Case description.
- [ ] B) They are generally not considered in Use Case modeling.
- [ ] C)  They are represented using specific UML notations within the diagram.
- [ ] D) They should be documented separately in a supplementary document.


### 12. What does a relationship between an actor and a use case represent?

- [ ] A) Inheritance
- [ ] B)  Communication or interaction
- [ ] C) Data flow
- [ ] D)  System dependency


### 13. What is the purpose of the "alternative" scenario in a Use Case?


- [ ] A) Describes the primary and most common interaction flow.
- [ ] B) Outlines steps to take when an error occurs.
- [ ] C)  Describes valid variations or branches in the main flow.
- [ ] D)  Defines the preconditions required for the Use Case to start.
