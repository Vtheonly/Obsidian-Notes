## Use Case Diagram Relationships Quiz (Actor/Use Case Details)

**Instructions:** Choose the **best** answer for each multiple-choice question based on the provided explanations.

**1. The statement "Relation Acteur/CU = Chemin de Communication Acteur/CU" essentially means:**
   - [ ] A) An actor always controls the execution of a use case.
   - [ ] B)  The relationship symbolizes the interaction pathway between an actor and a use case.
   - [ ] C)  An actor and a use case are the same thing in different contexts.
   - [ ] D)  A use case defines the internal workings of an actor.

**2. What does "Multiplicity" in the context of Use Case diagrams define?**
   - [ ] A) The number of actors that can be associated with a system.
   - [ ] B)  The number of use cases an actor can be related to.
   - [ ] C)  The number of times an actor can interact with a specific use case.
   - [ ] D)  The different types of actors that can use the system.

**3. If an actor has a multiplicity of "1..3" with a use case, this indicates that the actor:**
   - [ ] A) Can interact with the use case at least once, but no more than three times.
   - [ ] B)  Can interact with the use case at least one time and up to three times in a single session.
   - [ ] C) Must interact with the use case exactly three times.
   - [ ] D)  Can interact with three different variations of the use case.

**4.   The multiplicity symbol "*" on an actor-use case relationship means:**
   - [ ] A) The actor can never interact with the use case.
   - [ ] B)  The actor interacts with the use case exactly once.
   - [ ] C)  The actor interacts with the use case a specific, predefined number of times.
   - [ ] D)  The actor can interact with the use case multiple times or an undefined number of times.

**5. Which of the following multiplicities best represents an actor who may or may not interact with a use case, and if they do, they can do so any number of times?**
   - [ ] A) 1
   - [ ] B)  0..1
   - [ ] C)  1..*
   - [ ] D)  0..*

**6. An "Internal Use Case" is characterized by:**
   - [ ] A) Being initiated directly by multiple actors.
   - [ ] B)  Not having a direct association with any specific actor.
   - [ ] C)  Being more complex than external use cases.
   - [ ] D)  Being optional and used only under exceptional circumstances.

**7. Which of the following is the BEST example of an Internal Use Case?**
   - [ ] A) "Place Order" initiated by a Customer actor.
   - [ ] B) "Log In" initiated by a Registered User actor.
   - [ ] C) "Update System Logs" triggered automatically by the system.
   - [ ] D) "Manage Account" initiated by an Admin actor.

**8.   The primary reason for specifying multiplicity on an actor-use case relationship is to:**
   - [ ] A) Define the sequence of interactions.
   - [ ] B)  Clarify the allowed quantity or range of interactions.
   - [ ] C)  Identify the primary actor for the use case.
   - [ ] D)  Ensure that use cases are used simultaneously.

**9.   If a use case is connected to an actor with a multiplicity of "2", it implies that:**
   - [ ] A)  Two different actors must initiate the use case.
   - [ ] B)  The actor must initiate the use case twice in a row.
   - [ ] C) The actor initiates the use case and then must immediately perform it again for validation.
   - [ ] D)  The same actor must interact with the use case exactly two times.

**10. Specifying multiplicity on an actor-use case relationship ALWAYS implies:**
    - [ ] A)  Simultaneous execution of use cases by the actor.
    - [ ] B)  A defined numerical constraint on the interactions between actor and use case.
    - [ ] C)  That the use case is initiated by the same actor in different roles.
    - [ ] D)  That the use case is performed immediately after another specified use case.

**11. If a use case diagram shows an actor linked to a use case with no multiplicity specified, it is generally assumed that:**
    - [ ] A)  The actor cannot interact with the use case.
    - [ ] B) The actor can interact with the use case zero or more times (0..*).
    - [ ] C)  The actor interacts with the use case exactly once (1).
    - [ ] D)  The multiplicity needs to be further clarified as it is ambiguous.

**12. The concept of "communication path" in actor-use case relationships emphasizes:**
    - [ ] A)  The physical network connection between the actor and the system.
    - [ ] B)   The data exchanged during the interaction.
    - [ ] C) The way in which the actor triggers and interacts with the use case functionality.
    - [ ] D)  The sequence diagram that details the interaction.

**13. Consider a "System Administrator" actor and a "Backup Data" use case. What multiplicity would be MOST appropriate if the administrator can perform backups zero or more times?**
    - [ ] A)   1
    - [ ] B)   1..*
    - [ ] C)   0..1
    - [ ] D)  0..*

**14. Why are Internal Use Cases important in system modeling?**
    - [ ] A)   They represent the most common interactions users have with the system.
    - [ ] B)   They detail background processes and system tasks that are essential for operation.
    - [ ] C)   They provide a way to model error handling and exceptions.
    - [ ] D)  They define the different user roles within the system.

**15. The presence of an Internal Use Case in a diagram suggests that:**
    - [ ] A)  The system is overly complex and needs to be simplified.
    - [ ] B) The system has functionalities not directly triggered by external actors.
    - [ ] C)   The diagram is incomplete and needs additional actors.
    - [ ] D) The use case should be converted into an external use case for clarity.
