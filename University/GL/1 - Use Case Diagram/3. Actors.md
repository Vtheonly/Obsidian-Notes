Certainly, let's delve deeper into the types of actors in the context of Use Case Diagrams:

**Types dâ€™acteurs (Types of Actors):**
1. **Principal (Principal Actor):**
   - *Directly Concerned by the Described Use Case:*
     - A principal actor is directly involved or affected by the described Use Case. They are the primary entities for whom the system performs certain actions or provides specific functionalities.

   - *Solicits the System for Perceptible Results:*
     - Principals actively engage with the system to achieve tangible and noticeable outcomes. They initiate the Use Case, requesting the system to perform a particular function.

   - *Example:*
     - In an online shopping system, a "Customer" could be a principal actor for the "Place Order" Use Case.

2. **Secondaire (Secondary Actor):**
   - *Solicited for Additional Information Necessary for Execution:*
     - A secondary actor is not the primary beneficiary of the described Use Case, but they are involved to provide supplementary information or support required for the Use Case to proceed.

   - *Example:*
     - In an "Order Processing" Use Case, a "Payment Gateway" might be a secondary actor. While the customer (principal actor) initiates the order, the payment gateway (secondary actor) is involved to provide the necessary payment processing functionality.

**Hors champ (Out of Scope - Indirect Link):**
   - *Indirect Link to the System:*
     - An actor designated as "Hors champ" (Out of Scope) has an indirect link to the system. They are not directly involved in the described Use Case, but there might be some connection or influence.

   - *Example:*
     - In an "Inventory Management" Use Case, an "Auditor" might be considered out of scope. The auditor doesn't directly interact with the system for inventory management, but their audits could indirectly impact the system.

**Determining When to Designate an Actor as Principal or Secondary:**
   - **Principal Actor:**
     - Designate an actor as principal when they are the primary entities directly initiating or benefiting from the described Use Case. They are the main users or beneficiaries.

   - **Secondary Actor:**
     - Designate an actor as secondary when their involvement is supportive or when they provide additional information necessary for the execution of the Use Case. They are not the primary users but play a role in facilitating the Use Case.

Understanding the roles of principal and secondary actors helps in accurately representing the interactions between the system and external entities in a Use Case Diagram, providing a clear overview of who initiates actions and who supports the system in various scenarios.

Certainly! Here are three examples illustrating when to use primary and secondary actors in the context of Use Case Diagrams:

**1. Online Banking System:**
   - **Primary Actor: Customer**
     - The "Customer" is a primary actor when initiating a "Transfer Funds" Use Case. They directly benefit from the functionality and are the main entity driving the action.

   - **Secondary Actor: External Authorization Service**
     - An "External Authorization Service" might be a secondary actor. Although not directly initiating the transfer, this actor provides additional authentication or authorization support, playing a crucial role in the successful execution of the Use Case.

**2. Social Media Platform:**
   - **Primary Actor: User**
     - The "User" is a primary actor in the "Post a Photo" Use Case. They directly initiate the action and are the primary beneficiary.

   - **Secondary Actor: Image Recognition Service**
     - An "Image Recognition Service" could be a secondary actor. While the user is the primary actor posting the photo, this service may be involved to analyze or tag the image, providing additional functionalities to enhance the user experience.

**3. Hospital Management System:**
   - **Primary Actor: Doctor**
     - In a "Prescribe Medication" Use Case, the "Doctor" is the primary actor. They directly initiate the action and are the primary beneficiary of the system's capability.

   - **Secondary Actor: Pharmacy System**
     - The "Pharmacy System" could be a secondary actor. While the doctor prescribes medication, the pharmacy system is involved to handle the processing of the prescription, ensuring the availability of medications, and supporting the overall workflow.

In these examples, the primary actors are the main users or entities directly initiating and benefiting from the described Use Cases. Secondary actors, on the other hand, play supportive roles by providing additional services, information, or functionalities that contribute to the successful execution of the primary Use Cases.
