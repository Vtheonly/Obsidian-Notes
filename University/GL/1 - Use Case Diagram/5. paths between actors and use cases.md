The text you provided seems to discuss the relationship between actors and use cases in the context of communication paths and multiplicity. Let's break it down:

1. **Relation Acteur/CU = Chemin de Communication Acteur/CU (Actor/Use Case Relationship = Actor/Use Case Communication Path):**
   - **Explanation:** This part is stating that the relationship between an actor and a use case is essentially a communication path between the actor and the use case. In other words, it represents the way in which an actor interacts with a specific use case.

2. **Multiplicité (Multiplicity):**
   - **Explanation:** Multiplicity is a concept that defines the number of times an actor can interact with a use case. It allows you to specify the quantity or range of interactions between an actor and a use case.
  
   - **Details:**
      - If an actor can interact with a use case multiple times, you can add multiplicity.
      - The symbol "*" means many or several. "n" means exactly n, "n..m" means between n and m, and so on.
      - Specifying multiplicity on a relationship doesn't necessarily imply that the use cases are used simultaneously.

3. **Un CU qui n’est pas directement relié à un acteur est un CU interne (A Use Case not directly connected to an actor is an Internal Use Case):**
   - **Explanation:** This part emphasizes that a use case not directly linked to an actor is considered an internal use case. Internal use cases are those that are not initiated by external actors but are part of the system's internal functionalities.

   - **Example:** An internal use case could be something like "Initialize System" or "Perform Database Backup" which might be triggered by the system itself rather than an external user.

In summary, this text discusses the communication paths between actors and use cases, introduces the concept of multiplicity to specify the number of interactions, and highlights the distinction between use cases that are directly associated with actors and those that are considered internal to the system.
