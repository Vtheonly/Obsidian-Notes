1. **Actor/Actor: Generalization**
   - **Explanation:** In this context, the relationship between two actors involves generalization. This means that a specific actor (subtype) is a kind of the other actor (supertype). Modeling generalization is often used to show an "is a" relationship between actors.

   - **Example:** A "Customer" can be a generalized subtype of a more specific actor called "Premium Customer." The "Premium Customer" inherits attributes and behaviors from the basic "Customer."

2. **Actor/Use Case: Association**
   - **Explanation:** The association between an actor and a use case represents the interaction between the actor and the system to accomplish a specific objective. An actor can be associated with multiple use cases, and each use case can involve multiple actors.

   - **Example:** An actor "User" can be associated with the use case "Book a Room" in a hotel reservation system. The actor and the use case are linked by an association representing the user's interaction with the system to perform the reservation.

3. **Use Case/Use Case: Generalization, Inclusion, Extension**
   - **Generalization:** Similar to actors, generalization between use cases represents an "is a" relationship. A specific use case (subtype) is a kind of another use case (supertype).

   - **Inclusion:** Inclusion is used to break down a use case into smaller, reusable pieces. A use case may include another use case to describe common behavior shared among multiple use cases.

   - **Extension:** Extension is used to define additional scenarios (extensions) that can be added to a base use case based on certain conditions.

   - **Example:** In a hotel reservation system, the general use case "Book a Room" could be specialized into "Book a Standard Room" and "Book a Premium Room" (generalization). Additionally, it might include specific use cases such as "Add Extra Service" (inclusion) or "Get a Discount" (extension) based on certain conditions.

By using these modeling concepts, one can represent in detail the relationships and interactions between actors and use cases in a system.
