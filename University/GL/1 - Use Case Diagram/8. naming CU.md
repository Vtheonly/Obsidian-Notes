Choosing names for use cases is an important step in use case modeling. Use case names should be clear, descriptive, and typically follow a verb-noun format. The verb describes the action, and the noun represents the system or component involved. Here are some examples of use case names in a verb-noun format:

1. **Register User:** This use case describes the action of a user registering on a website or system.

2. **Place Order:** This use case represents the process of a user placing an order for products or services.

3. **Manage Inventory:** This use case covers actions related to handling and updating product inventory.

4. **Generate Report:** This use case involves the generation of reports based on specific criteria or data.

5. **Approve Leave Request:** This use case describes the action taken by a manager to approve or reject a leave request submitted by an employee.

6. **Search Catalog:** This use case represents the action of searching for items in an online catalog.

7. **Submit Payment:** This use case involves the process of a user submitting a payment for a product or service.

8. **Update Profile Information:** This use case covers actions related to users updating their profile details.

9. **Schedule Appointment:** This use case describes the process of scheduling an appointment with a service provider.

10. **Authenticate User:** This use case focuses on user authentication, including login and verification.

When naming use cases, it's important to be specific and concise, providing a clear understanding of the action and its context within the system. Following a verb-noun format helps maintain consistency and clarity in your use case diagrams and documentation.
