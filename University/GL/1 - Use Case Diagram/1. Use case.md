Based on the text you provided, the purpose of the use case diagram is to answer the fundamental question: "What purpose will the software serve?" It is a tool that helps in understanding the functionality of the system. The use case diagram helps to identify and describe how the system will be used, who will be using it, and the roles of different actors within the system. Additionally, it assists in documenting how each use case works and how the actors interact with the system, providing a clear overview of the system's functionality and its intended users.

A Use Case (CU) is a compilation of success or failure scenarios—nominal, alternative, and exceptional. It represents a business function of the system from the perspective of one of its actors. The Use Case serves as a model for the service provided by the system without specifying the implementation details, allowing for a focus on the functional aspects rather than the specific realization methods.

In essence, a Use Case provides a structured way of defining and understanding how the system interacts with its various actors to deliver a particular service or functionality. It captures a range of possible scenarios, including typical, alternative, and exceptional situations, offering a comprehensive view of the system's behavior from a user or external entity standpoint. Importantly, a Use Case abstracts away the technical intricacies, emphasizing the functionality and outcomes of the system's services without dictating the specific means by which those services are implemented.

**Key Aspects of a Use Case:**
- Describes a customer's need (customer-centric approach).
- Represents a function of the future system.
- Specifies how one or more actors use a system to achieve a goal—answering the question of 'what to do.'
- Emphasizes the viewpoints and goals of the user.

**Focus on User Perspectives:**
- Identifies system users.
- Explores their usage scenarios and goals.
- Defines a scenario as a specific sequence of actions and interactions between one or more actors and the system.

**Scenario Types:**
- A Use Case comprises success or failure scenarios—nominal, alternative, and exceptional.
- Aligns with a business function of the system based on the viewpoint of one of its actors.
- Models the service provided by the system without specifying the implementation details.

**How to Identify Use Cases:**
- To identify Use Cases:
  - Analyze the system from the perspective of each actor to understand how and why they use the system.
  - Avoid redundancies and limit the number of cases by maintaining a good level of abstraction.
  - Determine the appropriate level of detail for Use Cases, which is a challenging task requiring experience.
  - Temporal aspects are not considered in this context.

**Use Case Naming:**
- Name Use Cases using an infinitive verb followed by a complement.
- Choose names from the actor's perspective, not the system's perspective.

**Example:**
- For instance, a cash dispenser (ATM) would have a Use Case named 'Withdraw Money' instead of 'Distribute Money.'"

This detailed breakdown should provide a comprehensive understanding of the concept of Use Cases and how they are approached and named in system analysis.

Certainly, let's delve more deeply into the text about "Diagramme de CU" (Use Case Diagram) from a functional perspective:

**Diagramme de CU (Use Case Diagram): Point de vue fonctionnel (Functional Perspective - WHO DOES WHAT?)**

1. **Definition:**
   - The Use Case Diagram (Diagramme de CU or DCU) represents the structure of the major functionalities required by users of the system.
  
2. **Role of DCU:**
   - **System View in its External Environment:**
     - Provides a visual representation of how the system interacts with its external environment. It illustrates the boundaries of the system and its connections to external entities.

   - **Definition of Functionalities:**
     - Defines functionalities, outlining what the system should or should not do. It serves as a high-level overview of the capabilities offered by the system.

   - **Expression of Actor/Use Case Relationships:**
     - Expresses the relationships between actors (entities interacting with the system) and Use Cases (system functionalities). It shows which system elements are implemented to fulfill the needs of the actors.

   - **Foundation of the UML Model:**
     - Forms the basis of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standardized modeling language in software engineering. UML uses the concepts of actors and Use Cases to represent the functional aspects of a system.

3. **Actor Terminology in UML:**
   - In UML, the term "Utilisateur" (User) is replaced by "Acteur" (Actor). Actors in UML are entities external to the system that interact with it. They can be people, machines, or other systems.

4. **Actors and Use Cases:**
   - **Actors:**
     - Entities external to the system that interact with it. This includes individuals, machines, or other systems.

   - **Use Cases:**
     - Represent functionalities of the system from the perspective of the actors. Each Use Case defines a specific interaction or function that the system can perform to fulfill the needs of its users.
