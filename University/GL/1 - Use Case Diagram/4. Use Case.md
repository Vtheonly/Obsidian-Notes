### Definition of a Use Case

A Use Case is a collection of success or failure scenarios:
- Nominal, alternative, exceptional
- It corresponds to a business function of the system from the perspective of one of its actors.
- It models the service provided by the system without imposing the implementation mode.

It describes:
- A client's need (customer-centric approach)
- A function of the future system,
- How one or more actors use a system to achieve a goal - what to do?

It emphasizes the viewpoints and goals of the user:
- Who are the users of the system?
- What are their usage scenarios and goals?
- A scenario is a specific sequence of actions and interactions between one or more actors and the system.

#### How to identify Use Cases?

- To identify Use Cases:
  - One must consider the perspective of each actor and determine how and especially why they use the system.
  - Redundancies should be avoided, and the number of use cases should be limited by staying at a good level of abstraction.
  - Finding the right level of detail for use cases is a difficult problem that requires experience.
  - The temporal aspect is not taken into account.

#### Naming Use Cases

- Use an infinitive verb followed by a complement
- Place yourself from the perspective of the actor and not from that of the system.

For example:
- An ATM will have a Use Case: Withdraw money, not Dispense money.

### Use Case Diagram

#### Functional Perspective (WHO DOES WHAT?)

**Definition:** The Use Case Diagram (UCD) represents the structure of the major functionalities required by the system users.

**Role of UCD:**
- Provides a view of the system in its external environment.
- Defines functionalities: what the system should or should not do.
- Expresses actor/Use Case relationships (elements implemented by the system).
- Forms the basis of the UML model.

**UML does not use the term User, but Actor.**
- Actors = Entities that interact with the system (external to the system).
- Use Cases = System functionalities for actors.

#### Representation of Actors

Types of Actors:
- Primary:
  - Directly involved in the described Use Case.
  - Requests the system to obtain a noticeable result.
- Secondary:
  - Solicited for additional information necessary for the Use Case execution.
  - Out of scope (indirect link).

Different representations: small figure or stereotyped folder.

**NB.** When a Use Case introduces at least one secondary actor, the associations linking actors to Use Cases are stereotyped as `<<primary>>` or `<<secondary>>` as appropriate.

### Actor Relationships

#### Generalization/Specialization of Actors

- Only possible relationship between two actors.
- Example:
  - Actor 1 is a generalization of Actor 2, and Actor 2 is a specialization of Actor 1.
  - All Use Cases accessible to Actor 1 are also accessible to Actor 2, but the reverse is not true.

#### Association Relationship:

Actor/Use Case Relationship = Path of communication between actor and Use Case

- **Multiplicity:**
  - When an actor can interact multiple times with a Use Case, multiplicity can be added.
  - The symbol '*' denotes multiple, 'n' denotes exactly 'n', 'n..m' denotes between 'n' and 'm', etc.
  - Specifying multiplicity on a relationship does not necessarily imply that the Use Cases are used simultaneously.
- A Use Case not directly linked to an actor is an internal Use Case.

### Relation between Use Cases:

#### Generalization of Use Cases

- Use Case A is a generalization of Use Case B, read as "B is a kind of A."

#### Stereotyped Dependencies Most Used: Inclusion and Extension:

- **Inclusion (mandatory use case):**
  - To factorize a part of the description of a use case that would be common to other use cases.
  - To decompose a complex use case into simpler sub-use cases.
  - B is a mandatory part of A, and it's read as "A includes B" (in the direction of the arrow).

- **Extension (optional use case):**
  - Occurs at a specific point of the extended use case (extension point).
  - Can be associated with a constraint indicating when the extension occurs.
  - Often subject to a condition (expressed in the form of a note).
  - B is an optional part of A, and it's read as "B extends A" (in the direction of the arrow).

### Documentation of a Use Case (Textual Description)

All use cases of a system must be described in textual form. Although many UML diagrams can be used to describe a use case, it is recommended to describe it in textual form. This description can also be written with the help of other diagrams. It consists of three parts:

#### Part 1: Identification

This part helps in identifying the use case, and it includes:
- **Use Case Name**
- **Description:** A summary of its objective and contribution in terms of functionalities.
- **Involved Actors:** Both primary and secondary actors.
- **Creation and Update Dates of the Current Description**
- **Responsibles' Names:** Individuals involved in the elaboration of the use case, such as analysts, users, domain specialists, and clients.
- **Version Number**

#### Part 2: Sequencing

Scenarios describing the sequence of operations. It includes:
- **Description or Functional Specifications**
- **Precondition**
- **Nominal Sequence:** The current scenario's sequence of events.
- **Alternative Sequences:** Alternative paths or scenarios (then back to step 2).
- **Exception Sequences:** Error or exception scenarios (no return to step 2, signifies the end).
- **Post-condition**

The Part 2 (Sequencing) comprises three subsections:

1. **Nominal Sequence (Functioning):**
   - Description of the interactions between actors and the system to complete the use case.
   - Identification of actors and other potentially triggered use cases.
   - It begins by specifying the event triggering the use case (e.g., the user inserts their bank card).
   - It consists of three elements:
     - **Preconditions:** Indicate the system's state before the sequence unfolds (e.g., the ATM is loaded with cash).
     - **Main Scenario:** The sequence of messages (operations) + if a case X is included, "call case X" is added.
     - **Post-conditions:** Indicate the system's state after the nominal sequence unfolds (e.g., a transaction has been recorded by the bank).
2. **Scenarios Describing "Alternative" Cases + Triggering Condition**
3. **Scenarios Describing "Exceptional" Cases:** Network failure, server shutdown, etc. + Triggering Condition.

#### Part 3: Optional Sections

This part contains non-functional specifications, often technical specifications, and potential constraints related to human-machine interfaces. It may include:
- Technical specifications, such as ensuring secure access to banking information.
- Constraints related to human-machine interfaces, such as providing access to all user accounts from the main screen.

### Need Model = Use Case Diagram + Documentation

All use cases collectively must comprehensively describe the system's functional requirements (specifications).
