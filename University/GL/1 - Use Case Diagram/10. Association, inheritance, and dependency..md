In a class diagram, relationships are used to depict how classes are associated or connected to each other. There are several types of relationships, including association, inheritance, and dependency.

1. **Association:**
   - **Purpose:** Describes a structural relationship between classes. It represents how one class is related to another in terms of using or interacting with instances of the classes.
   - **Notation:** Represented by a line connecting two classes, with optional multiplicity notations (e.g., 1, *, 0..1).
   - **Example:** The association between `Person` and `Address` in an address book application.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - **Purpose:** Describes an "is-a" relationship between classes, indicating that one class is a specialized form of another class. It allows a subclass to inherit attributes and behaviors from a superclass.
   - **Notation:** Represented by an arrow pointing from the subclass to the superclass, often labeled with "extends" or "inherits."
   - **Example:** The inheritance relationship between `Car` and `Vehicle` where `Car` is a type of `Vehicle`.

3. **Dependency:**
   - **Purpose:** Describes a relationship where one class relies on another class. It typically occurs when a change in one class might affect another class.
   - **Notation:** Represented by a dashed arrow pointing from the dependent class to the class it depends on.
   - **Example:** A `Car` class might depend on a `FuelPump` class for fuel supply. If the `FuelPump` class changes, it could impact the `Car` class.

**Usage:**
- **Association:** Use association when two classes have a relationship, and instances of one class are connected to instances of another class. It's a more general and flexible relationship.
  
- **Inheritance:** Use inheritance when one class represents a specialized version of another class. It promotes code reuse and allows for polymorphism, where objects of the subclass can be treated as objects of the superclass.

- **Dependency:** Use dependency when one class relies on another class, but the relationship is more transient or loosely coupled. For example, if a class uses another class as a parameter in a method, there is a dependency.

In summary, association and inheritance are ways to express relationships between classes, while dependency indicates a weaker, more transient relationship between classes. None of these concepts are related to using a library in the sense of software development; they are fundamental concepts in object-oriented modeling. Libraries are collections of pre-written code or functions that can be used in your application, which is a different concept from relationships in a class diagram.
