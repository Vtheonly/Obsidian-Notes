**1. Lexical Analysis (Scanning)**

- **Definition:** The first phase of compilation, where the source code is read as a stream of characters and grouped into meaningful sequences called tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators, constants).
    
- **Input:** Raw source code as a sequence of characters.
    
- **Output:** A stream of tokens, each with an associated token type. Symbol table updated with found identifiers.
    

**2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**

- **Definition:** This phase checks if the stream of tokens conforms to the grammatical rules of the programming language, building a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the syntactic structure of the code.
    
- **Input:** A stream of tokens from the lexical analyzer.
    
- **Output:** A parse tree or AST representing the hierarchical structure of the program. Symbol table is further populated.
    
 
**3. Semantic Analysis**

- **Definition:** This phase verifies the meaning of the program, checking for type errors, undeclared variables, and other semantic inconsistencies, ensuring the program makes logical sense.
    
- **Input:** The parse tree or AST from the syntax analyzer.
    
- **Output:** An annotated parse tree/AST with semantic information (e.g., data types) and a more complete symbol table. Error reports if semantic issues found.
    

**4. Intermediate Code Generation**

- **Definition:** This phase translates the semantically checked AST into an intermediate representation (IR) of the program, which is platform-independent and closer to machine code but still relatively high-level. Common IR forms include postfix notation, three-address code, and abstract syntax tree representation.
    
- **Input:** The annotated parse tree/AST from the semantic analyzer.
    
- **Output:** Intermediate code in a chosen representation (e.g., postfix, three-address code, AST).
    

**4.5 Intermediate Code Optimization**

- **Definition:** In this phase, various techniques are applied to improve the efficiency of the intermediate code. This can involve eliminating redundant calculations, optimizing loops, and simplifying expressions, all while preserving the original meaning of the program.
    
- **Input:** Intermediate code.
    
- **Output:** Optimized intermediate code.
    

**4.6 Object Code Generation**

- **Definition:** The final phase translates the optimized intermediate code into machine code or assembly language specific to the target machine. This involves allocating registers, selecting instructions, and generating the final executable file.
    
- **Input:** Optimized intermediate code.
    
- **Output:** Object code (machine code or assembly language) for the target platform.
    



### potential errors 
here are 3 potential errors that can occur in each of the compiler phases we've been discussing:

**1. Lexical Analysis (Scanning) Errors:**

1. **Invalid Characters:** The source code contains characters that are not part of the language's defined character set.
    
    - **Example:** Using a $ symbol in a language where it's not a valid operator or part of an identifier.
        
    - "Unterminated string literal at line 10: Missing closing quote."
        
2. **Unterminated Comments:** A comment is started but never closed.
    
    - **Example:** /* This is a comment that is never closed...
        
    - "Unterminated comment starting at line 5."
        
3. **Malformed Numbers:** An improperly formatted numeric literal.
    
    - **Example:** 12.34.56 (too many decimal points) or 0xFG (invalid hexadecimal digit).
        
    - "Malformed numeric literal at line 22: Invalid digit 'G' in hexadecimal number."
        

**2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing) Errors:**

1. **Missing Semicolon:** A statement is missing a required semicolon at the end.
    
    - **Example:** x = 5 y = 10 (missing semicolon after the first statement).
        
    - "Syntax error at line 7: Expected ';' before 'y'."
        
2. **Mismatched Parentheses/Braces:** Parentheses or braces are not properly balanced.
    
    - **Example:** if (x > 5 { y = 10; (missing closing parenthesis).
        
    - "Syntax error at line 12: Unmatched '('."
        
3. **Incorrect Keyword Usage:** A keyword is used in an invalid context.
    
    - **Example:** return = 5; (using return as a variable name).
        
    - "Syntax error at line 18: Unexpected 'return'. Expected an identifier."
        

**3. Semantic Analysis Errors:**

1. **Type Mismatch:** An operation is performed on incompatible data types.
    
    - **Example:** int x = 5; string y = "hello"; x = x + y; (adding an integer and a string).
        
    - "Type error at line 5: Cannot add integer and string."
        
2. **Undeclared Variable:** A variable is used before it has been declared.
    
    - **Example:** x = y + 5; (where y has not been declared).
        
    - "Semantic error at line 8: 'y' is undeclared."
        
3. **Multiple Declaration:** A variable is declared more than once in the same scope.
    
    - **Example:** int x = 5; int x = 10;
        
    - "Semantic error at line 12: Redeclaration of 'x'."
        

**4. Intermediate Code Generation Errors:**

1. **Incorrect Operator Precedence:** The intermediate code does not correctly reflect the order of operations defined by the language.
    
    - **Example:** Source: x = a + b * c; Incorrect IR: t1 = a + b; x = t1 * c;
        
    - (Error during IR generation - the IR is incorrect). The error would have likely originated in earlier phases like parsing.
        
2. **Incorrect Address Calculation:** The intermediate code uses incorrect logic for calculating memory addresses, potentially leading to accessing the wrong memory locations.
    
    - **Example:** When dealing with arrays or pointers, incorrect offset calculations could happen.
        
    - (Error during IR generation).
        
3. **Unsupported Operation:** The source code contains an operation that cannot be translated into the chosen intermediate representation.
    
    - **Example:** Attempting to use a very high-level language feature that has no direct equivalent in the IR.
        
    - (Error during IR generation). These types of errors are less common if the previous phases are working correctly.
        

**4.5 Intermediate Code Optimization Errors:**

1. **Incorrect Dead Code Elimination:** Removing code that is actually necessary, leading to incorrect program behavior.
    
    - **Example:** Removing a statement that had a side effect that was not recognized by the optimizer.
        
    - "Error: Program output differs after optimization. Removed code was necessary for correct execution."
        
2. **Overly Aggressive Loop Optimization:** Modifying a loop in a way that changes its intended behavior.
    
    - **Example:** Unrolling a loop an incorrect number of times or making incorrect assumptions about loop invariants.
        
    - "Error: Program hangs or produces incorrect results after loop optimization. Loop conditions were altered incorrectly."
        
3. **Incorrect Constant Folding:** Replacing an expression with a constant value that is not equivalent due to factors like integer overflow or floating-point precision issues.
    
    - **Example:** Replacing x * 0 with 0 when x might be an infinity or NaN (Not a Number) in floating-point arithmetic.
        
    - "Error: Inconsistent behavior after optimization. Constant folding resulted in an incorrect value."
        

**4.6 Object Code Generation Errors:**

1. **Incorrect Register Allocation:** Assigning the same register to two different variables that are both in use at the same time, leading to data corruption.
    
    - **Example:** Overwriting a register that still holds a needed value before saving it to memory.
        
    - (Error during code generation). The program might crash or produce incorrect results.
        
2. **Incorrect Instruction Selection:** Choosing a machine instruction that does not correctly implement the intended operation from the intermediate code.
    
    - **Example:** Using an integer addition instruction when a floating-point addition was required.
        
    - (Error during code generation). The program will likely produce incorrect results.
        
3. **Target-Specific Errors:** Errors related to specific features or limitations of the target architecture.
    
    - **Example:** Generating code that exceeds the maximum allowed code size for a particular embedded system.
        
    - "Error: Generated code exceeds maximum allowed size for the target platform."
        

**Important Note:** These are just examples, and the specific error messages and behaviors will vary depending on the compiler, the programming language, and the target platform. Also, many errors that manifest in later stages like code generation may be rooted in problems from earlier stages that were not properly caught or handled.
