### What Does a Syntax Analyzer Do?

The **syntax analyzer**, also called a **parser**, is a key component in the compilation process. Its role is to ensure that the sequence of tokens provided by the lexical analyzer adheres to the grammatical rules of the programming language. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of its function:

1. **Input Handling:**  
    The syntax analyzer receives tokens (words or symbols) from the **lexical analyzer**, such as keywords, identifiers, or operators.
    
2. **Grammar Checking:**  
    It validates the arrangement of these tokens against the language's syntax, typically defined by **context-free grammar (CFG)** rules.
    
3. **Structure Creation:**  
    If the token sequence is correct, the parser constructs a **parse tree** or **abstract syntax tree (AST)**. These trees represent the hierarchical and logical structure of the program.
    
4. **Error Reporting:**  
    If a violation of syntax rules is found, the syntax analyzer reports **syntax errors**, often pointing out where in the code the issue occurs.
    

### Simplified Analogy:

- Think of the syntax analyzer as a grammar teacher who ensures that the "sentences" (code) written by a programmer follow proper grammar (syntax).
- While the lexical analyzer identifies individual "words" (tokens), the syntax analyzer checks if these "words" form valid "sentences."
