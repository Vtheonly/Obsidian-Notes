It seems there might be a repetition in the provided example. Let's correct and clarify the intermediate code for the given multiplication operation:

```plaintext
100 : *, b, c      // Multiply b and c and store the result at address 100
101 : +, a, 100    // Add the result of b * c to a and store the final result at address 101
```

Explanation:

1. **`100 : *, b, c`**:
   - This triplet represents the multiplication operation (`*`) between operands `b` and `c`.
   - The result of the multiplication is stored in memory at address `100`.

2. **`101 : +, a, 100`**:
   - This triplet represents the addition operation (`+`) between operand `a` and the result of the previous multiplication.
   - The final result of the addition is stored in memory at address `101`.

So, in the context of the given example, the intermediate code calculates the expression `a + b * c` and stores the result in memory. The addresses (`100` and `101`) are symbolic representations of memory locations used for temporary storage during the computation. These addresses are often replaced with actual memory addresses during subsequent phases of the compilation process.
