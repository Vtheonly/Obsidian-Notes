The concept of quadruplets introduces an additional level of control and abstraction compared to triplets. Quadruplets provide a more detailed representation of operations and values during the compilation process. Let's break down the provided example:

```plaintext
$1 : *, b, c
$2 : +, a, $1
```

Explanation:

1. **`$1 : *, b, c`**:
   - This quadruplet represents the multiplication operation (`*`) between operands `b` and `c`.
   - The result of the multiplication is stored in a temporary location represented by the variable `$1`.

2. **`$2 : +, a, $1`**:
   - This quadruplet represents the addition operation (`+`) between operand `a` and the result stored in `$1`.
   - The final result of the addition is stored in a temporary location represented by the variable `$2`.

In contrast to triplets, quadruplets introduce the use of named variables (e.g., `$1` and `$2`) to represent intermediate results. This provides more explicit control over where values are stored during the compilation process. The named variables act as placeholders for memory locations, and the compiler is responsible for managing these locations.

Advantages of using quadruplets include:

- **Explicit Control:** The programmer or compiler has explicit control over the naming and usage of temporary variables, making the code more readable and allowing for better optimization.
  
- **Memory Management:** The use of named variables allows for more efficient memory management during the compilation process.

- **Optimization Opportunities:** Quadruplets provide more information to the compiler, enabling it to perform additional optimizations based on the structure of the code.

However, it's important to note that the use of quadruplets also comes with increased complexity. The decision to use triplets or quadruplets often depends on the specific requirements of the compiler and the desired level of control over the compilation process.
