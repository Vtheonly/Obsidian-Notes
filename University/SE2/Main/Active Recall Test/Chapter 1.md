6. **In a task system, what is the role of an initial task?**  
   - [ ] It has no outgoing edges  
   - [ ] It has no incoming edges

   - [ ] It must finish before all other tasks  

7. **What is meant by task granularity?**  
   - [ ] The number of tasks in a system  
   - [ ] The level of detail in the tasks  
   - [ ] The overhead of task management versus the benefits of parallelism  
   - [ ] The speed of task execution  

8. **What is a behavior of a task system?**  
   - [ ] A method for organizing tasks  
   - [ ] A valid sequence of task executions respecting precedence constraints

   - [ ] All tasks must run sequentially  
   - [ ] Every task must read and write to the same variables  
   - [ ] The sequence of variable values assigned must be the same for all possible behaviors

    - [ ] They define the start and end of a task  
    - [ ] They determine the precedence relations  
    - [ ] They ensure task independence  
    - [ ] They do not have any significance
