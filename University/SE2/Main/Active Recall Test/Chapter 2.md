   - [ ] D. They are executed in the background without user intervention

7. **In the mutual exclusion problem, what does the variable `turn` control?**
   - [ ] A. The total number of processes
   - [ ] B. Which process gets to execute its critical section next
   - [ ] C. The amount of memory allocated to each process
   - [ ] D. The priority level of each process

   - [ ] B. Peterson's Algorithm
   - [ ] C. Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - [ ] D. Alternation Algorithm

9. **What does a semaphore initialized to `0` represent?**
   - [ ] A. A semaphore for mutual exclusion
   - [ ] B. A semaphore for blocking the process voluntarily
   - [ ] C. A semaphore for multiple simultaneous accesses
   - [ ] D. A semaphore for critical sections

10. **In the producer/consumer model, what happens if the buffer is full?**
    - [ ] A. Producers can continue to produce without waiting
    - [ ] B. Producers must wait until space is available
    - [ ] C. Consumers are blocked from consuming
    - [ ] D. The system crashes

11. **How is a counting semaphore typically used?**
    - [ ] A. To ensure only one process accesses a resource
    - [ ] B. To manage resources with multiple access points
    - [ ] C. To prevent any processes from executing
    - [ ] D. To block a process when entering the critical section

12. **In the readers/writers problem, what happens when a writer is accessing the resource?**
    - [ ] A. Other writers can access it simultaneously
    - [ ] B. All readers and writers are blocked from accessing it
    - [ ] C. Readers can access it but not other writers
    - [ ] D. The system locks the writer until it finishes

13. **What is the purpose of the `P` operation in semaphore management?**
    - [ ] A. To increment the semaphore value
    - [ ] B. To decrement the semaphore value and potentially block the process
    - [ ] C. To initialize the semaphore
    - [ ] D. To release the semaphore

14. **Which of the following statements is true about busy-waiting in process synchronization?**

    - [ ] B. It wastes CPU time when a process is in its critical section
    - [ ] C. It allows all processes to proceed without blocking
    - [ ] D. It guarantees efficient resource usage

15. **What is an example of interprocess communication (IPC) in the context of synchronization?**
