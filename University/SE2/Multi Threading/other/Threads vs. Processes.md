|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | An independent program with its own memory space.                       | A "lightweight" process that shares its memory space with other threads in the same process. |
| **Memory Space**        | Each process has its own separate memory space.                         | Threads within the same process share the same memory space.            |
| **Resource Sharing**    | Resources are not shared between processes.                              | Threads share resources such as code, data, and open files.             |
| **Creation Time**       | Creating a new process is relatively slow.                              | Creating a new thread is faster.                                        |
| **Context Switching**   | Context switching between processes is slower.                           | Context switching between threads is faster.                            |
| **Communication**       | Inter-process communication (IPC) is complex and slower.                | Inter-thread communication is simpler and faster.                       |
| **Overhead**            | Higher overhead due to separate memory spaces and resource allocation.   | Lower overhead due to shared memory and resources.                      |
| **Crash Impact**        | If one process crashes, it does not affect other processes.             | If one thread crashes, it can affect the entire process.                |
| **Synchronization**     | Synchronization between processes requires IPC mechanisms.               | Synchronization between threads can be achieved using simpler mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores. |
| **Use Cases**           | Suitable for tasks that require isolation and separate memory spaces.    | Suitable for tasks that require frequent communication and resource sharing. |
