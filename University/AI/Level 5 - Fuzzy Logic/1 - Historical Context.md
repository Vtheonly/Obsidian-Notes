# Chapter 4: Fuzzy Logic - History and Introduction

#ai #fuzzy-logic #history

## Historical Context

*   **1965:** The concept of the "**fuzzy set**" (ensemble flou) was introduced by Professor **Lotfi A. Zadeh** at the University of Berkeley, USA. This was proposed as an extension to classical set theory.

*   **1975:** Professor **Ebrahim Mamdani** from Queen Mary University of London proposed a fuzzy inference system specifically for controlling a steam engine. This marked a significant step towards practical applications.

*   **Late 1980s:** Fuzzy logic experienced significant growth, particularly in **Japan**. It began to be integrated into commercial products like washing machines and cameras, often advertised with the phrase "**fuzzy logic inside**".
    *   *Example Product:* ERMO482 XPRO Digital microwave barrier (up to 500m) featuring "FUZZY LOGIC INSIDE".

## Motivation

*   **Human-like Reasoning:** Fuzzy logic aims to mimic human reasoning, which often deals with imprecise information. For example, a driver doesn't need exact numerical values for acceleration or braking force.
*   **Handling Imprecision:** Decisions are often based on *imprecise* data, such as the *proximity* to a stop sign or traffic light (e.g., "close," "far," "approaching"). Classical logic struggles with such vagueness.
