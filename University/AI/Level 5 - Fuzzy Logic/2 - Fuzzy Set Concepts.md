## Classical Sets vs. Fuzzy Sets

*   **Classical Set Theory:** An element either *belongs* or *does not belong* to a set. There is no middle ground (binary membership).
    *   *Example:* Consider sets A = {ripe apples} and B = {unripe apples}.
    *   A specific apple, P, must belong exclusively to either set A or set B.
    *   *Question:* What about a half-ripe apple? Classical sets struggle with this ambiguity.
*   **Fuzzy Set Theory:** Elements can belong to a set to a certain *degree*. This allows for partial membership and gradual transitions.
    *   *Example:* Using the same apple example:
    *   A = {ripe apples} and B = {unripe apples}.
    *   A half-ripe apple P can belong to *both* set A and set B simultaneously, but with different **degrees of membership**.

## Linguistic Variables and Membership Functions

*   **Linguistic Variable:** Represents a concept that is being described in a fuzzy manner (e.g., `temperature`, `speed`, `height`).
*   **Linguistic Values (Terms):** Symbolic words associated with the linguistic variable (e.g., for `temperature`: `low`, `medium`, `high`).
*   **Universe of Discourse (U):** The range of all possible crisp (non-fuzzy) values that the linguistic variable can take (e.g., for `temperature`: perhaps -10°C to 50°C).
*   **Membership Function (μ):** A function that defines the degree to which a crisp value from the Universe of Discourse belongs to a specific fuzzy set (linguistic value).
    *   Maps each element `x` in the Universe of Discourse `U` to a value in the range **[0, 1]**.
    *   `μA(x): U → [0,1]`
    *   A value of `μA(x) = 1` means `x` fully belongs to fuzzy set A.
    *   A value of `μA(x) = 0` means `x` does not belong to fuzzy set A at all.
    *   Values between 0 and 1 represent partial membership.

### Example: Temperature

*   **Linguistic Variable:** Temperature
*   **Linguistic Values:** `Faible` (Low), `Moyenne` (Medium), `Élevée` (High)
*   **Universe of Discourse:** [14, 26] (degrees, presumably Celsius based on context)
*   **Membership Functions:** The graph shows how different temperature values map to degrees of membership for `Faible`, `Moyenne`, and `Élevée`.
    *   For example, a temperature of 18°C has a membership degree of ~0.5 in `Faible` and ~0.33 in `Moyenne`. A temperature of 24°C has a membership degree of ~0.8 in `Élevée`.
