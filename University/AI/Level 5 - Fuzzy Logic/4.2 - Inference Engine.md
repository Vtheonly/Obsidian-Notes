The **Inference Engine** is the core processing unit of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). It's where the "thinking" happens, combining the fuzzy inputs with the knowledge encoded in the rule base to produce a fuzzy output.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the Inference Engine is to **map the fuzzified inputs to a fuzzy output** by applying the logic defined in the IF-THEN rules. It essentially mimics a form of approximate reasoning based on the degrees of truth of the rule premises.

## Process Breakdown

The inference process typically involves these sequential steps:

1.  **Receive Fuzzified Inputs:**
    *   The engine takes the outputs from the Fuzzification stage. These are the degrees of membership (values between 0 and 1) of each crisp input variable in the relevant fuzzy sets.
    *   *Example:* Input Temperature is 21°C. Fuzzification determined $\mu_{Moyenne}(21) = 0.5$ and $\mu_{Élevée}(21) = 0.2$. These values (0.5, 0.2) are passed to the Inference Engine.

2.  **Evaluate Rule Antecedents (IF Parts):**
    *   For each rule in the Rule Base, the engine evaluates its antecedent (the IF part).
    *   If a rule has a single condition (e.g., `IF Temperature IS Moyenne`), the degree of truth of the antecedent is simply the membership degree of the input in that fuzzy set (e.g., $\mu_{Moyenne}(21) = 0.5$).
    *   If a rule has multiple conditions linked by **AND** (e.g., `IF Temperature IS Hot AND Humidity IS High`), the engine applies a fuzzy AND operator (commonly the `min` operator) to the membership degrees of the individual conditions. The result is the overall truth value of the combined antecedent.
        *   *Formula (AND/min):* $\alpha = \min(\mu_{Condition1}(input1), \mu_{Condition2}(input2), ...)$
    *   If a rule has multiple conditions linked by **OR** (e.g., `IF Temperature IS Cold OR Wind IS Strong`), the engine applies a fuzzy OR operator (commonly the `max` operator).
        *   *Formula (OR/max):* $\alpha = \max(\mu_{Condition1}(input1), \mu_{Condition2}(input2), ...)$
    *   The result of evaluating the antecedent for a specific rule is called its **firing strength** or **activation level**, often denoted by $\alpha$. This value (between 0 and 1) represents how strongly that rule applies given the current inputs.

3.  **Apply Implication (Connecting Antecedent to Consequent):**
    *   The firing strength ($\alpha$) calculated for each rule's antecedent is then used to determine the output fuzzy set contributed by that rule's consequent (the THEN part). This step is called fuzzy **implication**.
    *   There are different implication methods. The most common one, especially in **Mamdani-style inference**, uses the `min` operator (also known as **clipping**):
        *   **Clipping (min):** The fuzzy set defined in the consequent (e.g., "Heating IS High") is "cut off" or clipped at the level of the firing strength $\alpha$. The shape of the original consequent fuzzy set is preserved below this level.
        *   *Formula:* The resulting membership function for the output variable $z$, contributed by this single rule, is $\mu_{output\_rule}(z) = \min(\alpha, \mu_{consequent}(z))$, where $\mu_{consequent}(z)$ is the original membership function of the fuzzy set in the THEN part.
    *   *Alternative (Scaling/prod):* Another method, sometimes used, is scaling, where the original consequent fuzzy set is scaled down proportionally by the firing strength: $\mu_{output\_rule}(z) = \alpha \times \mu_{consequent}(z)$. We will focus on clipping for the example.

4.  **Aggregate Rule Outputs:**
    *   After applying the implication method to all relevant rules (i.e., all rules that have a non-zero firing strength), the engine will have several individual output fuzzy sets (one for each activated rule, typically clipped or scaled).
    *   These individual fuzzy sets, all defined on the Universe of Discourse of the *output* variable, must be combined into a single, final fuzzy set that represents the overall conclusion. This process is called **aggregation**.
    *   The most common aggregation operator is the fuzzy OR, implemented using the `max` operator.
        *   **Aggregation (max):** The final aggregated fuzzy set's membership function is the point-wise maximum of all the individual clipped/scaled output fuzzy sets from the rules.
        *   *Formula:* $\mu_{aggregated}(z) = \max(\mu_{output\_rule1}(z), \mu_{output\_rule2}(z), ..., \mu_{output\_ruleN}(z))$
    *   The result of this step is a single fuzzy set defined for the output variable (e.g., "Heating Power"). This aggregated fuzzy set encapsulates the combined recommendations from all the rules that were triggered by the inputs.

## Example: Simple Temperature Control

Let's walk through an example using Mamdani inference with `min` for AND/implication and `max` for OR/aggregation.

**Setup:**

*   **Input Variable:** Temperature ($T$)
*   **Output Variable:** Heating Power ($P$)
*   **Input Fuzzy Sets (Temperature):**
    *   `Moyenne` (Medium): Let's assume triangular MF (17, 20, 23).
    *   `Élevée` (High): Let's assume triangular MF (20, 23, 26).
*   **Output Fuzzy Sets (Heating Power):** (Universe of Discourse: 0% to 100%)
    *   `Faible` (Low): Triangular MF (0, 25, 50).
    *   `Moyen` (Medium): Triangular MF (25, 50, 75).
*   **Rule Base:**
    *   **Rule 1:** IF Temperature IS `Moyenne` THEN Heating Power IS `Moyen`.
    *   **Rule 2:** IF Temperature IS `Élevée` THEN Heating Power IS `Faible`.
*   **Crisp Input:** Current Temperature $T = 21$ °C.

**Inference Steps:**

1.  **Fuzzification (Given):**
    *   Calculate membership of $T=21$ in the input sets:
        *   $\mu_{Moyenne}(21)$: Using trimf(17, 20, 23) -> $\frac{23 - 21}{23 - 20} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67$.
        *   $\mu_{Élevée}(21)$: Using trimf(20, 23, 26) -> $\frac{21 - 20}{23 - 20} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33$.

2.  **Evaluate Rule Antecedents (Firing Strengths):**
    *   **Rule 1:** Antecedent is "Temperature IS `Moyenne`".
        *   Firing Strength $\alpha_1 = \mu_{Moyenne}(21) \approx 0.67$.
    *   **Rule 2:** Antecedent is "Temperature IS `Élevée`".
        *   Firing Strength $\alpha_2 = \mu_{Élevée}(21) \approx 0.33$.

3.  **Apply Implication (Mamdani - Clipping using `min`):**
    *   **Rule 1:** Consequent is "Heating Power IS `Moyen`".
        *   Clip the `Moyen` MF (triangle 25, 50, 75) at the level $\alpha_1 = 0.67$.
        *   The resulting shape $\mu_{output1}(P)$ is the original `Moyen` triangle but cut off horizontally at a height of 0.67.
        *   Mathematically: $\mu_{output1}(P) = \min(0.67, \mu_{Moyen}(P))$.
    *   **Rule 2:** Consequent is "Heating Power IS `Faible`".
        *   Clip the `Faible` MF (triangle 0, 25, 50) at the level $\alpha_2 = 0.33$.
        *   The resulting shape $\mu_{output2}(P)$ is the original `Faible` triangle cut off horizontally at a height of 0.33.
        *   Mathematically: $\mu_{output2}(P) = \min(0.33, \mu_{Faible}(P))$.

4.  **Aggregate Rule Outputs (using `max`):**
    *   Combine the two clipped fuzzy sets ($\mu_{output1}(P)$ and $\mu_{output2}(P)$) into one final fuzzy set for Heating Power.
    *   The membership function of the aggregated set is the point-wise maximum of the two clipped sets.
    *   $\mu_{aggregated}(P) = \max(\mu_{output1}(P), \mu_{output2}(P))$.
    *   Visually, this means laying the two clipped shapes on top of each other and taking the upper contour. The resulting shape will likely have a portion corresponding to the clipped `Faible` set (up to height 0.33) and another portion corresponding to the clipped `Moyen` set (up to height 0.67).

**Output of Inference Engine:**

The result of the Inference Engine stage is this final **aggregated fuzzy set**, $\mu_{aggregated}(P)$. This fuzzy set represents the combined recommendation for the Heating Power based on the rules and the input temperature. It is *not* yet a single crisp number; it needs to be passed to the Defuzzification module to get a concrete output value (like "Set Heating Power to 45%").
