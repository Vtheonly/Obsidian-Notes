Okay, here are the answers for TP NÂ° 4 translated into English.

**A. Dataframes**

**Q1: Determine in this code how names are associated with columns.**
*   **Answer:** Names are associated with columns directly during the data frame creation using the `data.frame()` function. The syntax `column_name = vector_of_data` is used. For example, `dispo = c(18, 10, 5, 20)` creates a column named "dispo" with the values specified in the vector `c(18, 10, 5, 20)`.

**Q2: What do you notice in the environment pane?**
*   **Answer:** In the environment pane, we observe:
    *   The name of the data frame (`myDF`).
    *   Its dimensions (`4 obs. of 4 variables`, meaning 4 rows and 4 columns).
    *   The list of variables (columns) with their names (`dispo`, `volume`, `profit`, `origine`).
    *   The data type for each column (`num` for numeric, `Factor` for the `origine` column).
    *   The first few values of each column.
    *   For the `origine` column, it's specifically indicated that it is a `Factor` with 3 levels ("Bresil", "France", "Inde"), and the numbers (`2 3 2 1`) represent the internal level indices for each row.

**Q3: How does R refer to the rows and columns of data frames? You can re-run the same code commenting out one of the columns.**
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Columns:** R names the columns using the names provided during creation (via `name = vector`) or those assigned later with `colnames()`. If no names are explicitly provided, R might try to infer them or use default names (like V1, V2, etc.), but naming them is highly recommended.
    *   **Rows:** By default, R names the rows with sequential numbers starting from 1 (e.g., "1", "2", "3", ...). However, custom row names can be specified during creation using the `row.names = vector_of_names` argument, as in the example (`row.names=c("semoule","riz",...)`). Row names can also be accessed or modified after creation using the `rownames()` function.
    *   **Re-running (commenting out):** If you comment out the line defining a column (e.g., `# volume=c(400, 300, 200, 500),`), R will produce an error when creating the data frame because all vectors provided as columns must have the same length. If you comment out the `row.names=...` line, the data frame will be created with the default row names ("1", "2", "3", "4").

**Q4: What is the type of the `origine` column?**
*   **Answer:** As indicated in the environment pane (Q2), the type of the `origine` column is `Factor`. R automatically converted the character vector into a factor because this is the default behavior (prior to R version 4.0.0).

**Q5: Execute the following code, then note the modifications that occurred in `myDF`.**
```R
rownames(myDF)
colnames(myDF)
colnames(myDF)<-c("col1","col2","col3","col4")
colnames(myDF)
# To restore the original names:
# colnames(myDF) <- c("dispo", "volume", "profit", "origine")
```
*   **Noted Modifications:**
    1.  `rownames(myDF)` displays the current row names: `"semoule" "riz" "farine" "lentille"`.
    2.  `colnames(myDF)` displays the current column names: `"dispo" "volume" "profit" "origine"`.
    3.  The statement `colnames(myDF)<-c("col1","col2","col3","col4")` **modifies** the column names of the `myDF` data frame.
    4.  `colnames(myDF)` (executed again) displays the **new** column names: `"col1" "col2" "col3" "col4"`.
*   **(Restoration)** To revert to the initial names, you would execute: `colnames(myDF) <- c("dispo", "volume", "profit", "origine")`

**Q6: Consider the code for creating the `myDF` data frame. Modify it by adding the parameter: `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`. Note the modifications that occurred in `myDF` in the environment pane, then deduce the role of this argument and its default value.**
*   **Modified Code:**
    ```R
    myDF<-data.frame(dispo=c(18, 10, 5, 20),
                   volume=c(400, 300, 200, 500),
                   profit=c(2000, 2500, 5000, 3500),
                   origine=c("France","Inde","France","Bresil"),
                   row.names=c("semoule","riz","farine","lentille"),
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE) # Added parameter
    ```
*   **Modifications in the Environment:** The main change will be visible for the `origine` column. Instead of being type `Factor`, it will now be type `chr` (character).
*   **Role of the Argument:** `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` prevents R from automatically converting columns containing character strings into factors when creating the data frame. It keeps them as simple character strings.
*   **Default Value:** Since the behavior *without* this argument was to convert to factors (as seen in Q4), the default value of `stringsAsFactors` in R versions before 4.0.0 is `TRUE`. (Note: In R 4.0.0 and later, the default became `FALSE`). Assuming the context of the exercise is based on the initial behavior, we conclude the implicit default here is `TRUE`.

**Q7: Display the values of `myDF[1,2]` and `myDF["semoule", "volume"]` then note if the result is the same.**
```R
myDF[1,2]
myDF["semoule", "volume"]
```
*   **Result:** Both commands display the value `400`. The result is the same. This shows that you can access an element using numeric indices (row 1, column 2) or row/column names ("semoule", "volume").

**Q8: Display the values of `myDF[,4]` and `myDF[,"origine"]` then note if the result is the same.**
```R
myDF[,4]
myDF[,"origine"]
```
*   **Result:** Both commands display the contents of the fourth column (the "origine" column). The result is the same (either a `Factor` or `character` vector depending on whether Q6 was executed). This shows you can extract an entire column using its numeric index or its name.

**Q9: Check if the syntax `myDF[2,"dispo"]` is valid. What is its value?**
```R
myDF[2,"dispo"]
```
*   **Answer:** Yes, the syntax `myDF[2,"dispo"]` is valid. It accesses the element located at the 2nd row and in the column named "dispo". Its value is `10`.

**Q10: Display the values of `myDF$origine` then note the result.**
```R
myDF$origine
```
*   **Result:** This command displays the contents of the column named "origine". The result is identical to that obtained with `myDF[,4]` or `myDF[,"origine"]`. It's another (often convenient) syntax for extracting a column by its name.

**Q11: Display the values of `myDF$4` and `myDF$"origine"` then note the result.**
```R
myDF$4
myDF$"origine"
```
*   **Result:**
    *   `myDF$4` produces an error (`unexpected numeric constant`) or returns `NULL`. The `$` operator expects a column name, not a numeric index.
    *   `myDF$"origine"` works and displays the content of the "origine" column, just like `myDF$origine`. Using quotes is necessary if the column name contains special characters or spaces, but it also works for standard names.

**Q12: Execute the following commands: `attach(myDF); origine`**
```R
attach(myDF)
origine
```
*   **Result:** The `attach(myDF)` command makes the columns of the `myDF` data frame directly accessible by their names in the current workspace. Subsequently, typing `origine` directly displays the content of that column (the `Factor` or `character` vector) without needing the `myDF$` prefix.

**Q13: Execute the following commands: `dispo<-10 ; attach(myDF)`. What do you notice?**
```R
dispo <- 10
attach(myDF)
```
*   **Observation:** After creating a variable `dispo` in the global environment (`dispo <- 10`), executing `attach(myDF)` produces a **warning message** similar to: `"The following objects are masked from .GlobalEnv: dispo"`. This means there are now two objects named `dispo`: the one just created (value 10) and the one from the attached data frame. The attached version is "masked" by the one in the global environment. If you type `dispo` after these commands, R will display `10`, not the vector from the "dispo" column of the data frame. This illustrates a potential source of confusion when using `attach()`. (You can use `detach(myDF)` to undo the attachment).

**B. Saving data frames to csv files**

**Q14: Execute the command `write.csv(myDF, file = "myDF.csv")` then verify if the csv file was created.**
```R
write.csv(myDF, file = "myDF.csv")
# Verification: Open file explorer or use list.files() in R
list.files(pattern = "myDF.csv")
```
*   **Verification:** Yes, the command creates a file named `myDF.csv` in R's current working directory.

**Q15: Display its content.**
*   **Answer:** You can open the `myDF.csv` file with a text editor (Notepad, VSCode, etc.) or a spreadsheet program (Excel, LibreOffice Calc). The content will look similar to this (quoting might vary slightly):
    ```csv
    "", "dispo", "volume", "profit", "origine"
    "semoule", 18, 400, 2000, "France"
    "riz", 10, 300, 2500, "Inde"
    "farine", 5, 200, 5000, "France"
    "lentille", 20, 500, 3500, "Bresil"
    ```
    Note the first unnamed column (represented by `""` in the header) which contains the original data frame's row names.

**Q16: Execute the following command then identify the problem. `myImportDF1<-read.csv(file = "myDF.csv")`**
```R
myImportDF1 <- read.csv(file = "myDF.csv")
# Examine myImportDF1 in the RStudio environment or with:
str(myImportDF1)
head(myImportDF1)
```
*   **Problem Identified:**
    1.  The imported data frame (`myImportDF1`) has **5 columns** instead of the original 4.
    2.  A new column named `X` has been added at the beginning. It contains the old row names ("semoule", "riz", etc.).
    3.  The **row names** of `myImportDF1` are now the default numbers ("1", "2", "3", "4").
*   **Cause:** By default, `write.csv` writes the row names into an unnamed first column. By default, `read.csv` reads this first column as a data column (naming it `X` because the header was empty) and assigns default row numbers.

**Q17: Display the row and column names to see more clearly: `colnames(myImportDF1)` `rownames(myImportDF1)`**
```R
colnames(myImportDF1)
rownames(myImportDF1)
```
*   **Result:**
    *   `colnames(myImportDF1)` displays: `[1] "X" "dispo" "volume" "profit" "origine"`
    *   `rownames(myImportDF1)` displays: `[1] "1" "2" "3" "4"`
    *   This confirms the observations from Q16.

**Q18: Execute the following code then identify the meaning (use help for this) of the argument that allowed the association of names to their rows. `myImportDF2<-read.csv(file = "myDF.csv",row.names=1)`**
```R
myImportDF2 <- read.csv(file = "myDF.csv", row.names = 1)
colnames(myImportDF2)
rownames(myImportDF2)
# Consult help
?read.csv
```
*   **Meaning of `row.names=1`:** This argument tells the `read.csv` function that the **first column** (column number 1) of the CSV file should be used as the **row names** for the data frame created in R, instead of being read as a data column. The help (`?read.csv`) confirms that `row.names` can be a number indicating which column contains the row names.

**Q19: What do you notice when executing `str(myImportDF2$dispo)`?**
```R
str(myImportDF2$dispo)
```
*   **Observation:** The output shows `int [1:4] 18 10 5 20` (or similar). We notice that the type of the `dispo` column is `int` (integer). Whereas in the original `myDF` data frame, it was likely type `num` (numeric, usually double-precision). `read.csv` inferred the `integer` type because all the values read in this column were whole numbers.

**Q20: Is the variable `myImportDF3` identical to `myDF`?**
```R
# Code from TP (with potential colClasses typo)
# myImportDF3<-read.csv(file = "myDF.csv",row.names=1,
#                      colClasses = c("character", "numeric", "numeric",
#                                     "numeric","factor"))

# Likely Corrected Code (to match the 4 data columns)
myImportDF3<-read.csv(file = "myDF.csv",row.names=1,
                     colClasses = c("numeric", "numeric", "numeric","factor"))
# Check structure
str(myImportDF3)
str(myDF) # Compare with the structure of myDF (ideally the one WITHOUT stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# More formal comparison
identical(myDF, myImportDF3) # or all.equal(myDF, myImportDF3)
```
*   **Answer (using the corrected `colClasses` `c("numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "factor")`):**
    *   The `colClasses` argument allows explicitly specifying the type for each column during import, thus preventing R's automatic type inference (like the change to `int` seen in Q19).
    *   By specifying `"numeric"` for the `dispo`, `volume`, `profit` columns and `"factor"` for `origine` (which matches the types of the original `myDF` data frame, where `origine` was a factor by default), the structure of `myImportDF3` becomes very similar, or even identical, to that of `myDF` (if comparing to the initial `myDF` where `origine` was a factor).
    *   Executing `str(myImportDF3$dispo)` will now show `num [1:4] ...`.
    *   The function `identical(myDF, myImportDF3)` will likely return `TRUE` if comparing to the original `myDF`. If comparing to the `myDF` created with `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`, it will return `FALSE` because the type of the `origine` column will differ (`Factor` vs `character`).
*   **Note on the TP's `colClasses`:** The vector `colClasses = c("character", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric","factor")` provided in the exercise has 5 elements, whereas after using `row.names=1`, there are only 4 data columns left to read. Executing with this exact vector might cause an error or warning depending on the R version. The answer above assumes the use of the likely intended corrected vector `c("numeric", "numeric", "numeric","factor")`.

**C. User Functions**

**Q21: Is the result the same for these calls? Why?**
```R
mafonction <- function(a,b,c=3) {
  result <- a * b + c
  return(result)
}
# Call 1 (positional)
mafonction(5,3,11)
# Call 2 (named)
mafonction(b=5, a=11, c=3)
```
*   **Answer:** No, the result is not the same.
    *   The call `mafonction(5, 3, 11)` uses positional arguments: `a` gets the value 5, `b` gets the value 3, and `c` gets the value 11. The calculation is `5 * 3 + 11 = 15 + 11 = 26`.
    *   The call `mafonction(b=5, a=11, c=3)` uses named arguments: `a` gets the value 11, `b` gets the value 5, and `c` gets the value 3. The calculation is `11 * 5 + 3 = 55 + 3 = 58`.
*   **Why:** The results differ because the values assigned to the parameters `a` and `b` are different in the two calls. The first call relies on the order of arguments, while the second uses the argument names for assignment, allowing them to be provided in any order.

**Q22: Remove the initialization value of the argument b. Re-execute and comment. `mafonction(10)`**
*   **Modification:** The function `mafonction` as written in the exercise (`mafonction <- function(a, b, c=3)`) **already does not have** an initialization value (default value) for the argument `b`. Only `c` has a default value (`c=3`). The question therefore seems to ask to execute the call `mafonction(10)` with the function *as it is*.
*   **Execution:**
    ```R
    mafonction(10)
    ```
*   **Result:**
    ```
    Error in mafonction(10) : argument "b" is missing, with no default
    ```
*   **Comment:** Executing `mafonction(10)` causes an error. This is because the call only provides one value (10), which is assigned to the first argument (`a`) by position. The argument `b` received no value in the call and has no default value defined in the function signature. Therefore, R cannot execute the function body (`a * b + c`) because the value of `b` is missing, hence the explicit error message.
