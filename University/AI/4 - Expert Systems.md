Let's dive into the topic of Expert Systems, focusing on the components of an expert system, examples of rules and facts, as well as the inference engines such as forward chaining, conflict resolution strategies, and backward chaining.

### Expert Systems Overview:
Expert Systems (ES) are programs designed to replicate the cognitive mechanisms of an expert in a specific domain. They are composed mainly of:
- A **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Contains facts and rules.
- A **Rule Base (RB)**: Contains rules that define the behavior of the system.
- An **Inference Engine (IE)**: Responsible for making deductions or inferences based on the rules and facts.

### Example:
Let's consider an example of an expert system with the following knowledge:
- **Knowledge Base (BF)**:
  - Fact 1: Animal has feathers (D)
  - Fact 2: Animal has a long neck (E)
  - Fact 3: Animal has long legs (F)

- **Rule Base (BR)**:
  - Rule 1: "IF animal flies AND animal lays eggs THEN animal is a bird" (A ∧ B → C)
  - Rule 2: "IF animal has feathers THEN animal is a bird" (D → C)
  - Rule 3: "IF animal is a bird AND animal has a long neck AND animal has long legs THEN animal is an ostrich" (C ∧ E ∧ F → G)

### Inference Engine:
#### Forward Chaining (Iterative):
1. **Initial State**: BF = {D, E, F}, BRA = {R1, R2, R3}, Goal = G
2. **Iteration 1**: Choose R2: D → C, BF = {D, E, F, C}, BRA = {R1, R3}
3. **Iteration 2**: Choose R3: C ∧ E ∧ F → G, BF = {D, E, F, C, G}, BRA = {R1}
   - Goal (G) is reached, STOP. Conclusion: The animal is an ostrich.

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies:
- **First-Rule Strategy**: Chooses the first applicable rule.
- **Last-Fact Strategy**: Chooses the last fact in the BF.
- **Condition-Aware Strategy**: Considers the conditions in rules before selecting.

### Backward Chaining:
Backward chaining uses inductive reasoning. Let's apply it to the previous example:
- **Initial State**: BF = {D, E, F}, Rules = R1:A ∧ B ∧ S → C, R2:D → C, R3: C ∧ E ∧ A → G, Goal = G
- **Cycle 1**: R3: C ∧ E ∧ F → G, as it's the only rule with G as a consequent. Since C is not in BF, Goal = C.
- **Cycle 2**: Rules R1 and R2 have C as a consequent. Choose R2 (D → C) since there are no unknowns in its antecedent. Update BF={D, E, F, C}.
- **Cycle 3**: R3 infers G, and the initial goal (G) is proved.

### And/Or Tree:
The And/Or tree associated with the previous example is as follows:
```
         R3
     C ∧ E ∧ F → G
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
     /    |    \
    R1    R2    F1
  A ∧ B ∧ S → C   D
```

### Exercise: Proving H by Backward Chaining:
Given the following KB, prove H using backward chaining:
- **Knowledge Base (BF)**:
  - Fact 1: M
  - Fact 2: P ∧ Q
- **Rule Base (BR)**:
  - Rule 1: "IF P THEN S"
  - Rule 2: "IF Q THEN R"
  - Rule 3: "IF S AND R THEN H"

The And/Or tree associated with this would be:
```
         R3
    S ∧ R → H
      /  \
     /    \
    R1     R2
    P → S  Q → R
     |      |
     P      Q
```

This tree shows the possible paths to proving H by checking S, R, P, and Q. By following the rules, we can determine if H can be proven from the given facts and rules.

An expert system is a tool capable of replicating the cognitive mechanisms of an expert in a specific domain. It is one of the paths attempting to achieve artificial intelligence.
- An expert system is a computer program simulating human intelligence in a particular field of knowledge or regarding a specific problem.
- Specifically, an expert system is software capable of answering questions by reasoning from known facts and rules.
- It can serve as a decision-making aid.
- The first expert system was "DENDRAL," used for identifying chemical constituents.

An expert system is composed of 3 parts:
- A knowledge base (KB)
- A rule base (RB)
- An inference engine (IE).
- The inference engine can use facts and rules to produce new facts until arriving at the expert question's answer.
- Most existing expert systems rely on mechanisms of formal logic:
  - The simplest ones on propositional logic, where propositions are either true or false.
  - Others on first-order predicate logic.

Three categories are often distinguished based on how problems are solved:
- Engines using "Forward Chaining" start with facts and rules from the knowledge base, aiming to reach the sought-after facts.
- Engines using "Backward Chaining" start with the sought-after facts and try to "trace back" to known facts using rules.

PROLOG is well-suited for formalizing expert systems, developed by AI researchers.
- An expert system has three essential components:
  - A knowledge base: statements about facts of all kinds in the domain.
  - A set of decision rules: methods, procedures, and reasoning schemes used in the domain.
  - An inference engine: subsystem applying decision rules to the knowledge base.

These three points are straightforward to implement in a PROLOG program:
- The knowledge base consists of facts and some rules to avoid exhaustive enumeration of all facts.
- Decision rules are PROLOG rules.
- The inference engine is the PROLOG interpreter itself.

In computer science, rule-based systems are used to store and manipulate knowledge to interpret information usefully.
- Knowledge is stored as rules in the rule base (also known as knowledge base).
- Rules are in the form IF (Conditions) THEN (Actions).

Matching Phase: The inference mechanism (IM) searches the current problem data in the working memory (WM) and tries to match it with the knowledge base's content to see which rules can be fired.
- There may be more than one rule that can be fired when antecedents match or when consequences match, depending on whether forward chaining or backward chaining is used.
- If multiple rules can be fired, a subset of rules is selected in this selection phase, also known as conflict resolution phase.
- New facts are generated and inserted into the working memory (WM), allowing other rules to match.
- The interface sits between the inference engine and the user. It translates system responses from an internal representation to something the user can understand; it presents system questions to the user and verifies answers.
- This cycle continues until no further rule matches or until the initial system goal is reached.

1- Forward chaining: Guided by data. If a ∧ b ∧ c Then p. With a rule like this, we start checking the antecedents' match to choose a rule. The firing rule produces p as a new fact inserted into the working memory, which may enable further searches.
2- Backward chaining: Guided by the goal. If a ∧ b ∧ c Then p, we start with the goal, p, and need to prove a, b, c.

Rule-based systems have been applied in expert systems.
