Okay, let's break down the decision tree construction using the "Play Tennis" example from your slides.

**1. The Goal**

The main goal is to build a model (the decision tree) based on past data (the 14 days of weather and whether tennis was played) that can predict whether tennis will be played (`PlayTennis` = Yes/No) for a *new* day, given its weather conditions (Prévisions, Température, Humidité, Vent). This is a **supervised classification** problem because we have labeled data (we know the outcome `PlayTennis` for the training examples) and the outcome is categorical (Yes or No).

**2. The Core Idea: Splitting the Data**

Imagine you have the whole dataset (all 14 days) in one big pile. You want to ask a question about one of the attributes (like "What are the Prévisions?") that splits this pile into smaller piles (e.g., one pile for 'Overcast', one for 'Rain', one for 'Sunny') such that each smaller pile is *more homogeneous* (less mixed) in terms of the outcome (`PlayTennis`) than the original big pile. You repeat this process for the smaller piles until the piles are "pure" (all Yes or all No) or you decide to stop.

**3. How to Choose the "Best" Split? Entropy and Information Gain**

How do we mathematically decide which question (which attribute) gives the best split? We use two concepts:

*   **Entropy (H): Measures Impurity/Disorder**
    *   **Concept:** Entropy tells us how mixed a set of examples is. A set with only 'Yes' examples or only 'No' examples is pure (Entropy = 0). A set with a 50/50 mix of 'Yes' and 'No' is the most mixed (maximum Entropy).
    *   **Formula (Slide 5 / Handwritten p2):** `H(S) = - Σ [pi * log2(pi)]`
        *   `S`: The set of examples (e.g., the whole dataset, or a subset at a node).
        *   `pi`: The proportion (fraction) of examples belonging to class `i` (e.g., proportion of 'Yes', proportion of 'No').
        *   `Σ`: Sum over all classes.
    *   **Example (Whole Dataset - Slide 8 / Handwritten p4):**
        *   Total examples = 14
        *   PlayTennis = Yes: 9 examples (p_yes = 9/14)
        *   PlayTennis = No: 5 examples (p_no = 5/14)
        *   `H(S) = - (9/14) * log2(9/14) - (5/14) * log2(5/14) ≈ 0.940`
        *   This value (0.940) represents the initial impurity of the entire dataset.

*   **Information Gain (Gain): Measures Reduction in Entropy**
    *   **Concept:** Information Gain calculates how much the entropy (impurity) decreases *after* splitting the dataset based on a particular attribute. We want the attribute that gives the *highest* reduction in entropy, meaning it creates the purest subsets.
    *   **Formula (Slide 7 / Handwritten p3):** `Gain(S, A) = H(S) - Σ [(|Sv| / |S|) * H(Sv)]`
        *   `S`: The current set of examples.
        *   `A`: The attribute we are considering splitting on (e.g., 'Prévisions', 'Vent').
        *   `H(S)`: The entropy of the set *before* splitting.
        *   `v`: A possible value of attribute `A` (e.g., for 'Prévisions', v could be 'Sunny', 'Overcast', or 'Rain').
        *   `Sv`: The subset of `S` where attribute `A` has value `v`.
        *   `|Sv|`: The number of examples in subset `Sv`.
        *   `|S|`: The total number of examples in set `S`.
        *   `H(Sv)`: The entropy of the subset `Sv`.
        *   `Σ [(|Sv| / |S|) * H(Sv)]`: This is the *weighted average entropy* of the subsets created by splitting on attribute `A`. The weights are the proportions of examples going into each subset.
    *   **Interpretation:** Gain = (Entropy before split) - (Average entropy after split). A higher gain means a better split.

**4. Building the Tree: The Algorithm (ID3)**

The algorithm builds the tree recursively (top-down):

*   **Step 1: Start at the Root Node**
    *   Consider the entire dataset (S).
    *   Calculate `H(S)` (already done, 0.940).
    *   Calculate the Information Gain for *each* attribute:
        *   `Gain(S, Prévisions)` (Calculated on Slide 8 ≈ 0.247)
        *   `Gain(S, Température)` (Given on Slide 8 ≈ 0.029)
        *   `Gain(S, Humidité)` (Given on Slide 8 ≈ 0.152)
        *   `Gain(S, Vent)` (Calculated on Slide 7 ≈ 0.048)
    *   **Choose the attribute with the highest Gain.** In this case, it's **Prévisions** (0.247). This becomes the **root node** of the tree.

*   **Step 2: Create Branches**
    *   Create a branch for each possible value of the chosen attribute ('Prévisions'): 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rain'.
    *   Divide the dataset into subsets based on these values:
        *   `S_sunny`: Days where Prévisions = Sunny (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 11 - Contains 2 Yes, 3 No)
        *   `S_overcast`: Days where Prévisions = Overcast (Days 3, 7, 12, 13 - Contains 4 Yes, 0 No)
        *   `S_rain`: Days where Prévisions = Rain (Days 4, 5, 6, 10, 14 - Contains 3 Yes, 2 No)

*   **Step 3: Repeat Recursively for Each Branch/Subset**

    *   **Branch 'Overcast':**
        *   Look at the subset `S_overcast` ([4 Yes, 0 No]).
        *   Is it pure? Yes, all examples are 'Yes'.
        *   **Action:** Create a **leaf node** labeled 'Yes'. Stop on this branch. (See Slide 9)

    *   **Branch 'Rain':**
        *   Look at the subset `S_rain` ([3 Yes, 2 No]). Entropy `H(S_rain) ≈ 0.971`.
        *   Is it pure? No.
        *   **Action:** Repeat Step 1 *for this subset*, considering the *remaining* attributes (Température, Humidité, Vent).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_rain, Température)` ≈ 0.020 (Slide 9 calculation details likely omitted but result given).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_rain, Humidité)` ≈ 0.020 (Slide 9).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_rain, Vent)` ≈ 0.971 (Slide 9).
            *   Choose the attribute with the highest gain: **Vent**. This becomes the node for this branch.
            *   Create branches for 'Vent': 'Weak' ([3 Yes, 0 No]) and 'Strong' ([0 Yes, 2 No]).
            *   Branch 'Weak': Pure (all Yes) -> Leaf Node 'Yes'.
            *   Branch 'Strong': Pure (all No) -> Leaf Node 'No'.
            *   Stop on this branch.

    *   **Branch 'Sunny':**
        *   Look at the subset `S_sunny` ([2 Yes, 3 No]). Entropy `H(S_sunny) ≈ 0.971`.
        *   Is it pure? No.
        *   **Action:** Repeat Step 1 *for this subset*, considering the *remaining* attributes (Température, Humidité, Vent).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_sunny, Température)` ≈ 0.571 (Slide 9 / Handwritten p6).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_sunny, Humidité)` ≈ 0.971 (Slide 9 / Handwritten p6).
            *   Calculate `Gain(S_sunny, Vent)` ≈ 0.020 (Slide 9 / Handwritten p6).
            *   Choose the attribute with the highest gain: **Humidité**. This becomes the node for this branch.
            *   Create branches for 'Humidité': 'High' ([0 Yes, 3 No]) and 'Normal' ([2 Yes, 0 No]).
            *   Branch 'High': Pure (all No) -> Leaf Node 'No'.
            *   Branch 'Normal': Pure (all Yes) -> Leaf Node 'Yes'.
            *   Stop on this branch.

*   **Step 4: Stop**
    *   The algorithm stops when all branches end in pure leaf nodes, or other criteria are met (like reaching a maximum depth, having too few examples to split, or no more attributes available).

**5. How the Operations Work (Summary)**

*   **Entropy `H(S)`:** Calculates the initial impurity of a set S based on the proportion of classes within it. Lower value = purer set.
*   **Information Gain `Gain(S, A)`:** Calculates the *expected reduction* in entropy if you split set S using attribute A. It's the difference between the entropy *before* the split (`H(S)`) and the *average entropy* of the subsets created *after* the split.
*   **Choosing the Root/Node:** At each step, calculate the Information Gain for all *available* attributes on the *current subset* of data. Select the attribute with the **Maximum Information Gain** to be the splitting node.
*   **Recursion:** Apply the process (calculate gains, choose best attribute, split) to the new subsets created by the split, until the subsets are pure (become leaves).

The final tree (shown on Slide 3, Slide 9, Slide 12, Handwritten p7) is the result of this recursive partitioning process based on maximizing information gain at each step.
