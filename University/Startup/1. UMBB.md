## Cycle of the Company's Life

After their inception, companies go through stages akin to childhood, adolescence, and eventual maturity (in the case of a successful enterprise). Following this trajectory, some companies may cease to exist, while others evolve and transition into new phases of development. Each stage demands unique management techniques tailored to the company's growth.

## The Entrepreneur's Mindset

In addition to expertise, interpersonal skills, and technical competencies, entrepreneurship demands a specific mindset that must be cultivated and nurtured, notably:

- Leadership and a taste for challenges,
- Setting objectives,
- Vision (fostering creativity and innovation),
- Ambition and motivation,
- Determination and patience,
- Endurance and perseverance,
- Self-confidence and risk-taking.

## Finding a Startup Idea

A new idea often arises almost by chance, and those that succeed are often the simplest (except in the case of fundamental and applied research in major laboratories). It often involves filling a gap that one has personally experienced in an industry or providing a solution (product or service) to meet a specific need, only to realize that the need exists elsewhere. Every day, we encounter situations that could be improved, and a large number of unmet demands can give us ideas for products or services.

## The Startup Ecosystem

The entrepreneurial ecosystem is an interconnected set of actors, organizations, institutions, and processes that combine in multiple ways within a local entrepreneurial environment. This name comes from the Greek: "oikos," meaning "house," and "sustÃªma," meaning "assembly, composition, organization," which has given rise to "system."

## Launching Solo or With a Team

Developing a startup alone often comes with risks, especially since potential competitors may be well-established on their end. Support networks are growing every day (incubators, startup accelerators, etc.), offering advice in various areas (business development, marketing, business plan creation, financial aspects, etc.).

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**
- It's better to partner with someone who shares our vision and has complementary skills, but a 50/50 partnership can lead to deadlock in decision-making during disagreements.
- Associating with a friend is not always advisable, as excessive trust can lead to impracticality, etc.
- Sometimes, working together can yield higher gains than working alone.
- Fear of loneliness often drives creators to partner up, but it's preferable to launch solo and foster a collaborative work environment.
- Collaboration between partners allows for faster analysis and progress, amplifies creativity, and accelerates business development.
- Sharing the burden of problems is an advantage of partnerships.
- An isolated entrepreneur is a weak entrepreneur; together, partners can face obstacles more effectively.
- Genuine harmony is a key element of partnership.
- However, if we are alone, we must bear all the risks associated with our project.
- Finally, it's said that it's better to be alone than to be in bad company.

## Growth and Sales

To survive, businesses must grow and progress. Those experiencing rapid growth have several strategies to achieve this. It's essential to continuously search for the root causes of our failures and successes and make necessary adjustments promptly.

**a) Market Penetration:**
The goal is to maintain the same product or service for an existing market to increase market share and sales to existing customers. This strategy involves lower levels of innovation and fewer risks.

**b) Product Development:**
Products are developed and marketed to existing customers. Product life cycles shorten as technological progress advances, pushing companies to constantly develop new products. Significant investments in research and development, production, and sales are required.

**c) Market Development:**
This involves launching an existing product in new markets, developing new applications for an existing product, or establishing new geographical markets domestically or internationally.

**d) Diversification:**
This strategy combines the development of new products and markets. It's more suitable for larger companies as it involves significant resources and higher risks.

[[Q5]]

## Mistakes, Failures, and Best Practices

**a) Main Causes of Failure:**
- Lack of demand: The offer doesn't meet the needs of the public.
- Lack of funds: Entrepreneurs abandon projects due to a lack of funds to pay employees and suppliers.
- Inappropriate team: Projects fail if team members lack experience, motivation, or skills.
- Intense competition: Tough competition requires significant resources to establish a position among larger competitors.
- High costs: Competitive pricing is essential.
- Poor product quality: Low-quality offerings fail to attract customers.
- Ineffective marketing: Poor marketing and communication can damage a company's reputation.
- Neglecting the customer: Failing to address customer expectations for product improvement.
- Poor timing: Good ideas may arrive too early or too late for market acceptance.

**b) Best Practices for Startups:**
- Customer listening: Prioritize customer satisfaction in your strategy.
- Prototyping for refinement: Prototyping can transform ideas into valuable offerings.
- Prioritizing tasks: Startups are often overwhelmed with various tasks; prioritization is crucial.
- Building an email list: An email list facilitates easy communication of company and product information, engaging potential customers.

## From Idea to Market

To stay aligned with market trends and technological advancements, companies must innovate continuously.

**II-1. Customer and Product Development:**
Investing in new products and services and their development forms the basis of a company's growth and profitability. Before diving into the development process, organization and planning are essential. Success in product development relies on identifying what potential customers want. Understanding the product and service lifecycle stages helps choose the right time to initiate development. The customer service department is best positioned to meet customer expectations as they are closest to them.

**II-2. Building and Formalizing a Business Model:**
The business model plays a central role in a company's creation project, precisely describing how a company will progress. It involves defining:
- Product or service offerings,
- Targeted clientele,
- Objectives to achieve,
- Strategy,
- Resources and means to be implemented.

Finding a good business model requires observation and intuition. Understanding customer expectations, market offerings, and potential improvements is crucial. Seeking competitive advantages is necessary for building a solid business model. Approaches may include:
- Developing an offering that stands out from competitors by introducing innovation or offering better product quality.
- Cost optimization for a viable project.
- Exploring new, less competitive markets with good potential.

Describing the business model answers questions like:
- What products or services are offered?
- What are its advantages compared to competitors?
- Who is the target clientele?
- What are the objectives to achieve and with what strategy?
- What resources and means are implemented?
[[Q7]]

## The Art of Pitching

A "pitch" is a concise summary of a project, idea, or presentation for a startup in the process of creation (for a new product or service) delivered within an extremely limited timeframe or paragraph.

Describing a project that one has been working on for weeks or even months in just a few sentences or minutes is not easy. However, it is a highly useful and constructive step.

Pitching enables us to present and defend the project close to our hearts. In doing so, we must:
- Clearly and succinctly explain the why and how of the project.
- Provide the right and essential information.
- Engage our audience.
- Reassure our listeners.
- Convey the right message.
- Conclude positively.

**Preparation of the Pitch:**
To avoid improvisation, preparation is essential. In the case of a group pitch, roles should be allocated: one speaks, the other manages visual presentations; one asks questions, the other answers them. One can also allocate different areas of focus: marketing, communication, finances, etc.

## From Market to Growth

**III-1. Growth Hacking or the Cult of Growth**

Growth hacking is a practice that involves employing all possible marketing means to generate rapid growth (exponential growth with minimal testing).

To implement growth-hacking techniques in a startup, specific goals must be set, and the marketing needs of the company understood.

Growth hacking is not a ready-made solution. It stems from:
- Reflection,
- Understanding of users and targets,
- Repeated trials, which are often initially unsuccessful before becoming successful.

**III-2. Fundraising and Valuation**

**a) Startup Valuation in Fundraising**

The valuation of a company corresponds to its market value at a specific moment. It takes into account the past, present, and future projections.

Valuing a startup is not straightforward because it lacks any historical data, and its future lies in uncertain realms. However, investors should not be given free rein to assign an approximate value without defending it, or conversely, overvalue it in hopes of reaching an acceptable value.

Startup valuation, especially in its startup phase, is neither based on exact science nor official methods.

When startup associates decide to raise funds, they must determine the financing needs and then value their startup.

[[Q9]]

**b) Methods for Valuing a Startup**

There are several methods for valuing a company. Given the absence of historical activity and customer base, several traditional valuation methods for companies are not applicable to startups. It is impossible to use:
- Asset-based valuation,
- Valuation based on historical performance (margin, EBIT, result...),
- Valuation calculated based on turnover.

These methods are reserved for valuing traditional and established companies (i.e., those with a few years of activity behind them), and they are not suitable for startups in the fundraising phase.

Thus, valuation can only be based on future results or by comparison with similar operations. Investors may also take into account their experience and market trends to get an initial idea of valuation on a startup. When other competing startups exist, comparisons can be made with their fundraising rounds.

[[Q10]]

**c) Valuation Criteria for Startups**

The first criterion is based on the cohesion of the team, their skills, the alignment between each member's expertise and the project's needs, and the experience of each participant. The presence of one or more experienced entrepreneurs is an asset.

Next, the consistency of the project is also crucial (potential). Therefore, it is necessary to analyze:
- The characteristics of the target market,
- The developed concept,
- Innovations,
- Progress in product or service research and development,
- Competitive advantages,
- The business model.

Finally, investors will naturally be interested in the financial forecast, primarily the income statement and cash flow plan.
[[Q11]]
**III-3. Crowdfunding: Marketing and Financial Lever**

Crowdfunding is a mechanism aimed at collecting financial contributions from a large number of individuals through an online platform. The purpose of this collection is to finance a project.

Crowdfunding, or participatory financing, is an exchange of funds between individuals outside institutional financial channels, to fund a project through an online platform.

Participatory financing is a mechanism that allows for the collection of funds, usually small amounts, from a wide audience. Fundraising is done based on the description of a specific project through an online platform that collects the funds deposited.

Finally, crowdfunding allows the project owner to conduct a sort of market study at a lower cost and to benefit from advice and support from investors.

## Administration and Management

**IV-1. Startup Kit: Legal/Social/Fiscal/VAT**

**a) Legal form of the company**

Depending on the legal form chosen for the company (sole proprietorship, corporation), the tax regime and decision-making system will be different:

- LLC (Limited Liability Company);
- SAS (Simplified Joint Stock Company);
- SA (Public Limited Company).

The choice of legal form and the drafting of the company's articles of incorporation must ensure adaptability and flexibility to allow the startup to grow and evolve into a larger form over the years.

It is advisable to choose a limited liability company such as an LLC or SAS. Thus, the liability of the founders will be limited to the amount of their contributions to the startup in case of failure.

The legal form should also facilitate the entry and exit of shareholders. It is also important to choose a form that allows for the free drafting of articles of incorporation and to provide for the modalities of opening the share capital.
[[Q13]]

**b) Company taxation**

In terms of corporate tax regime, there is corporate tax and income tax.

Finally, the Value Added Tax (VAT), which is paid without being truly aware of it as a consumer, becomes a tangible and concrete reality for every entrepreneur.

**c) Social Environment**

The social environment of a company represents all external factors that can influence the profitability and success of a business activity. The evolution of these factors leads to the emergence of risks or opportunities. The social environment concerns demographics, culture, morality, and lifestyles of the local population. The development of a company depends in part on its environment, especially social:

- Size;
- Age distribution;
- Family structure;
- Religion;
- Culture;
- Trends;
- Needs;
- Purchasing power.

[[Q14]]


**IV-2. Tools for Managing, Developing, and Communicating About Your Business**

To ensure the sustainability and long-term development of the company, it would be wise to manage the activity through good management, as it is necessary to have a real-time and predictive vision of the company's situation.

**a) Tools for Good Management**

For short-term management, the manager follows, using a dashboard, the indicators that allow him to have a vision of daily, weekly, or monthly activity, and to be able to make decisions quickly if a need arises.

In the medium term, the business owner focuses on investments and financing.

Finally, in the long term, the manager makes projections and estimates based on the past and present to determine the company's future.


**b) Objectives of Management**

The primary purpose of management is to assist in decision-making (in addition to measurement and analysis) and therefore enable action.

**c) Qualities for Good Management**

One must allocate the time and attention necessary to carefully examine the company's data regularly to detect warning signals and act accordingly.

In addition to analytical skills and resulting actions, the business owner must be able to plan.
[[Q15]]


**IV-3. Access to Market and Sales - Business Development - Web Marketing**

**a) Choosing an Entry Mode:**

Decide whether to sell directly to end-users or to intermediaries such as wholesalers and distributors.

Take into account financing and insurance needs:

To determine the amount and type of financing needed to support an export project, it's essential to calculate all costs affecting working capital (foreign buyers may request longer payment terms). Consider taking out insurance to protect your business against unforeseen events.

Drafting the strategy document:

Record all details of the market entry strategy. This document will be useful for obtaining the necessary funding and will serve as a framework for the export marketing plan.

**b) Business Development:**

Business development encompasses processes aimed at improving the performance and profitability of a company. There are three main stages in designing a business development plan:

- Analyzing the situation: Consider the economic context, competitive environment, and main opportunities available to the company. Develop an internal assessment to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the company.
- Setting objectives: Evaluate labor and equipment needs and estimate the gains that can be generated by improving these elements.
- Establishing an action plan: Identify marketing actions to reach the target audience and achieve the set objectives.

**c) Web Marketing:**

Web marketing comprises specific marketing techniques for the internet. A website allows for direct interaction with customers, gathering their opinions, maintaining and expanding revenue, and selling products and services online.

**d) Performance Management:**

Performance management begins with implementing an appropriate evaluation system. This step is crucial for effectively measuring the company's performance and assessing the effectiveness of actions taken to optimize it.

Performance management tools:

These tools are methods that aid decision-making (e.g., the Quality Action Plan helps better satisfy customers by contributing to the organization's performance).

Key performance indicators:

Performance indicators allow real-time monitoring of commercial activity to implement corrective actions in case of deviation from objectives.

Involved sectors:

The company's strategy and overall objectives originate from management. Service managers, process drivers, and all organization stakeholders are involved in performance management at operational or strategic levels and with varying degrees of involvement.

An enterprise is an economic unit with legal autonomy, primarily tasked with producing goods or services for the market. Innovation, on the other hand, encompasses scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial endeavors aimed at creating or improving technologically new products or processes.

An innovative enterprise distinguishes itself by commercializing new or improved products or services, or by introducing new or improved processes into its production system. Conversely, a startup is defined by its initial idea and its potential for significant growth. Unlike a traditional enterprise, a startup is structured to search for and refine its business model.

The criteria for being considered a startup do not depend on age, size, or sector of activity but rather on four main conditions: a strong growth potential, the use of new technology, the need for massive funding, and the exploitation of a new market with difficult-to-assess risks.

To transform an idea into a successful enterprise, several steps are necessary:

1. **The Idea:** It can stem from solving an unmet need, intuition, a new concept, or leveraging technology to address a need.

2. **Market Research:** To measure the quality of the idea by understanding various market aspects, validating its relevance, and adapting it to customer expectations.

3. **Business Plan or Model:** Identifying essential elements for business development, defining profitability, margin, and cost.

4. **Partners:** Finding trustworthy, competent collaborators aligned with the project.

5. **Support:** Seeking assistance from domain experts, specialized organizations, and legal frameworks or incubation programs.

6. **Funding:** Securing funds for creation, operation, incubation, launch, and growth expenses.

7. **Prototyping:** Converting the idea into reality by building, testing, and iterating the product or service.

8. **Launch:** Introducing the product to the market through commercialization and customer outreach.
