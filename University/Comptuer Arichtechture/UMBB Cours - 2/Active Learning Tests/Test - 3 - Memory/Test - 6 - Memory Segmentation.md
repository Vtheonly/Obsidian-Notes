[[answer-1]]

**Question 2**  
- [ ] A) Each memory address in segmentation has a segment number and an offset.  
- [ ] B) Segmentation eliminates the need for offsets.  
- [ ] C) Only one segment is used in logical memory segmentation.

[[answer-2]]

**Question 3**  
- [ ] A) Offset represents the most significant bits of a memory address.  
- [ ] B) Segment number is used to find the exact position within a segment.

- [ ] D) Offset specifies the segment in a multi-tasking system.  
[[answer-3]]

**Question 4**  
- [ ] A) Segmentation allows each segment to represent a part of a program like code or data.  
- [ ] B) In segmentation, all memory addresses are treated the same.  
- [ ] C) Segments can only be used to represent processes, not program parts.

[[answer-4]]

**Question 5**  
- [ ] A) B bits determine the offset in memory segmentation.  
- [ ] B) N - B bits determine the segment number.  
- [ ] C) The segment number is found using B bits.  
- [ ] D) Segmentation uses B bits for determining data size.  
[[answer-5]]

**Question 6**  
- [ ] A) Logical memory segmentation only works with a fixed number of segments.  
- [ ] B) Address space is divided into segments and offsets for easier memory management.

[[answer-7]]

**Question 8**  
- [ ] A) Each segment in memory segmentation is physically stored separately.  
- [ ] B) Segmentation refers to the division of address space, not the physical storage.  
- [ ] C) Segmentation guarantees faster memory access.  
- [ ] D) Offset directly controls the number of segments.  
[[answer-8]]

**Question 9**  
- [ ] A) Segment number and offset combine to form the complete memory address.  
- [ ] B) Offset is the sole identifier of a memory location.  
- [ ] C) Segment number is optional in segmentation.  
- [ ] D) Segmentation requires no consideration of memory size.  
[[answer-9]]

**Question 10**  
- [ ] A) The segment number is always larger than the offset.  
- [ ] B) Logical segmentation involves mapping memory addresses directly to physical addresses.  
- [ ] C) Segmentation helps organize memory into logical units.  
- [ ] D) Offset is used to determine the segment in which data resides.  
[[answer-10]]

**Question 11**  
- [ ] A) Logical segmentation is only effective for small programs.  
- [ ] B) Segmentation can represent different parts of a program like code and stack.  
- [ ] C) Segmentation and paging are identical.  
- [ ] D) Segmentation is used to remove complexity in memory management.  
[[answer-11]]

**Question 12**

[[answer-14]]

**Question 15**  
- [ ] A) Segmentation reduces the total address space.  
- [ ] B) Addressing with segmentation involves a segment number and an offset.
