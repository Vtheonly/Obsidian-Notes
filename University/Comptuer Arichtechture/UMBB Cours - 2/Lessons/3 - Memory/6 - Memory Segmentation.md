Here’s an explanation in English about **Logical Memory Segmentation**:
[[Test - 6 - Memory Segmentation]] 
### Logical Memory Segmentation

**Memory segmentation** is a technique used to logically divide memory into smaller, manageable blocks or segments. It provides a way for the system to manage memory more efficiently, especially in complex programs or multi-tasking environments. Here’s how it works:

#### Memory Segmentation Overview
- **Segmentation** divides memory into different blocks (called **segments**). Each segment is treated as a separate unit, which can represent different parts of a program (e.g., code, data, stack) or different processes in a multi-tasking system.
- Each memory address is divided into two parts:
  - **Segment number** (or **block number**).
  - **Offset** (the exact location within the segment).

#### Addressing in Segmentation
When using segmentation, an address is encoded as follows:
- **B bits (most significant bits)** represent the **segment number** (block number). These bits identify which segment the memory access is directed to.
- **N - B bits (least significant bits)** represent the **offset within the segment**. The offset tells the system the exact position within the selected segment where the data is stored.

#### Example:
If you have an address space of **2ᴺ memory locations**, the address is divided into two parts:
1. **B bits** are used for the segment number, which can reference up to **2ᴮ segments**.
2. **N - B bits** are used as the offset, which can address up to **2ᴺ⁻ᴮ** locations within each segment.

This method allows the system to access memory by first selecting the appropriate segment and then moving to the desired location within that segment.

#### Key Points:
- **Segmentation** helps with memory management by breaking memory into logical pieces.
- Each memory address is split into a **segment number** and an **offset**.
- The number of segments is determined by the **B bits**, while the offset within each segment is determined by the remaining **N - B bits**.
- The total memory space remains **2ᴺ** memory locations, but they are logically organized into segments.

In summary, **memory segmentation** helps improve memory organization by dividing the address space into distinct segments, with each address consisting of both a segment number and an offset. This approach makes memory management more flexible and efficient, especially in complex systems.
