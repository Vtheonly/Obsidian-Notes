Here’s an explanation in English:

**Central Memory** (RAM - Random Access Memory) is a critical part of a computer, where data and instructions are stored temporarily while being used. The following explains the **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)** and its characteristics:
[[Test - 4 - Memory DRAM]] 
### DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
- **Dynamic**: Unlike **SRAM (Static RAM)**, **DRAM** is dynamic, meaning the stored information fades over time and needs to be refreshed periodically to maintain it. Without refresh, the data would be lost.
  
- **1 bit = 1 Transistor + 1 Capacitor**: Each bit of information in **DRAM** is stored in a memory cell, which consists of:
  - **A transistor**: Works like a switch that controls access to the capacitor.
  - **A capacitor**: Stores an electrical charge representing the bit’s value (1 or 0). A charged capacitor represents a “1,” while a discharged one represents a “0.”

  This design makes **DRAM** cheaper and easier to manufacture in large quantities than **SRAM**, but it is slower and requires constant refreshing.

### Memory Structure
- The information in memory is organized into **words**, which are groups of bits. The word length can vary, typically **8, 16, 32, or 64 bits**, depending on the system’s architecture.
  
  For example, a 64-bit architecture processes and stores 64-bit words. The word length defines the **memory format** and impacts how much information can be handled simultaneously.

### DRAM Speed
- **DRAM** is relatively **slow** compared to the processor’s speed due to the time it takes to refresh the cells and how the memory is organized.
  
  To make up for this slower speed, **cache memory** (often **SRAM**) is used between the processor and DRAM. This cache stores frequently accessed data, improving speed by reducing delays from accessing the
