*Downloading the Datasets and Example Code*

This book is about using R and Python to perform machine science tasks. Of course, you can spend all your time creating the example code from scratch, debugging it, and only then discovering how it relates to machine learning, or you can take the easy way and download the prewritten code so that you can get right to work. Likewise, creating datasets large enough for machine learning purposes would take quite a while. Fortunately, you can access standardized, procreated data sets quite easily using features provided in some of the machine learning libraries. The following sections help you download and use the example code and datasets so that you can save time and get right to work with machine learning– specific tasks.


*Understanding the datasets*

used in this book Most of the datasets used in this book come directly from the R datasets package. You can find a listing of these datasets at

[[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html]]

If you want to see these datasets in RStudio, simply type data() in a blank file, and the IDE shows it to you. Figure 4-11 shows typical output from typing data().
