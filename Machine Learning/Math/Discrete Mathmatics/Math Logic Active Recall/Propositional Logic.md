1. Which of the following best defines a **proposition** in propositional logic?
   - [ ] A mathematical equation
   - [ ] A condition that can only be true
   - [ ] A possible situation or condition that can be either true or false
   - [ ] A condition that always holds under logical operations

2. What is an **atomic proposition**?
   - [ ] A proposition that combines multiple conditions
   - [ ] A simple statement that expresses a basic fact about the world
   - [ ] A statement with at least one logical connector
   - [ ] A condition that must always be true

3. Which of the following is a correct **example of an atomic proposition**?
   - [ ] $\neg p$
   - [ ] $p \land q$
   - [ ] $\text{pleuvoir\_ou\_neiger}$
   - [ ] $p \Rightarrow q$

4. In propositional logic, the **negation** operator ($\neg$) is used to:
   - [ ] Reverse the truth value of a proposition
   - [ ] Combine two propositions
   - [ ] Imply a condition
   - [ ] Equate two propositions

5. According to the **truth table for negation**, what is the result of $\neg p$ if $p$ is false?
   - [ ] True
   - [ ] False
   - [ ] Undefined
   - [ ] Both true and false

6. The **conjunction** operator ($\land$) in propositional logic is used to:
   - [ ] Reverse the truth of a proposition
   - [ ] Combine two propositions such that both must be true for the result to be true
   - [ ] Express an implication
   - [ ] Compare two propositions for equivalence

7. In the **truth table for conjunction** ($p \land q$), the expression is true only when:
   - [ ] Either $p$ or $q$ is true
   - [ ] Both $p$ and $q$ are true
   - [ ] Both $p$ and $q$ are false
   - [ ] Either $p$ or $q$ is false

8. The **disjunction** operator ($\lor$) represents which logical relationship?
   - [ ] And
   - [ ] Or
   - [ ] Not
   - [ ] Implies

9. According to the **truth table for disjunction** ($p \lor q$), under what condition is the result false?
   - [ ] When both $p$ and $q$ are true
   - [ ] When $p$ is true and $q$ is false
   - [ ] When both $p$ and $q$ are false
   - [ ] When either $p$ or $q$ is true

10. Which operator in propositional logic expresses **implication**?
    - [ ] $\land$
    - [ ] $\lor$
    - [ ] $\Rightarrow$
    - [ ] $\Leftrightarrow$

11. In the **truth table for implication** ($p \Rightarrow q$), under which condition is the expression false?
    - [ ] When both $p$ and $q$ are true
    - [ ] When $p$ is true and $q$ is false
    - [ ] When both $p$ and $q$ are false
    - [ ] When $p$ is false and $q$ is true

12. The **equivalence** operator ($\Leftrightarrow$) is true when:
    - [ ] Both $p$ and $q$ have different truth values
    - [ ] $p$ is true, regardless of $q$
    - [ ] Both $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value
    - [ ] $q$ is false, regardless of $p$

13. In propositional logic, the **expression $p \Rightarrow q$** is also commonly understood as:
    - [ ] $p$ or $q$
    - [ ] If $p$ then $q$
    - [ ] $p$ and $q$
    - [ ] Not $p$

14. Which statement is **false** about the **truth table for equivalence** ($p \Leftrightarrow q$)?
    - [ ] It is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true
    - [ ] It is true when both $p$ and $q$ are false
    - [ ] It is false when $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value
    - [ ] It is false when $p$ and $q$ have different truth values

15. In propositional logic, which of the following represents the **inverse of the implication** $p \Rightarrow q$?
    - [ ] $\neg p \lor q$
    - [ ] $p \land \neg q$
    - [ ] $p \lor q$
    - [ ] $\neg p \Rightarrow \neg q$
