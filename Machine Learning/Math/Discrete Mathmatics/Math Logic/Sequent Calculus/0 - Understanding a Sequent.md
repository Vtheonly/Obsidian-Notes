Alright, let’s break this down step-by-step. This passage introduces the "Calcul des Séquents" (Sequent Calculus), a formal system in proof theory created by Gerhard Gentzen. Let's start with the basics. 

### Axioms and Inference Rules

The initial lines explain the purpose of "calcul des séquents" or sequent calculus:

- **"Calcul des Séquents"**: This is a **formal deductive system** developed by Gentzen. The name refers to a distinct approach in formal deduction.
- **Sequent**: A sequent consists of **a series of hypotheses** (or premises) followed by **a series of conclusions**. The hypotheses and conclusions are typically separated by the symbol `⊢`.

### 2. **Understanding a Sequent**

In simpler terms:

- A sequent is a way of representing an **intermediate step** in a formal proof or demonstration.
- The sequent calculus explicitly outlines **the operations** allowed on a sequent in order to construct a complete, valid proof.

Let’s move on to the first definition:

### Definition 1.7.1: **What is a Sequent?**

A sequent is defined as a pair `< Γ, Δ >`:

- Here, `Γ` and `Δ` represent **finite sets of formulas**.
- Normally, the notation `< Γ, Δ >` is written as `Γ ⊢ Δ`.

#### Example Explanation:

1. **If** `Γ = {A1, A2, ..., An}` and `Δ = {B1, ..., Bk}`, the sequent `{A1, ..., An} ⊢ {B1, ..., Bk}` simply becomes:
   - `A1, ..., An ⊢ B1, ..., Bk`

2. **Additional Notation**:
   - If we have a formula `X` and two sets `Γ` and `Δ`, we write `Γ, X ⊢ Δ` instead of `Γ ∪ {X} ⊢ Δ`.
   - When there are no hypotheses, we can write `⊢ Δ` instead of `∅ ⊢ Δ`.

Let me know if this part is clear or if you'd like a further breakdown before we proceed with the next section on **sequent semantics**.



Great, let’s keep going step-by-step!

### 3. **The Semantics of a Sequent**

Next, we move on to the **meaning** or **semantics** of a sequent, which tells us how to interpret the truth of a sequent.

#### Definition 1.7.2: Semantics of a Sequent

- Let `I` be an **interpretation** that maps the set of sequents to **truth values** `{0, 1}`:
   - `0` represents **false**, and `1` represents **true**.

- For a given sequent `Γ ⊢ Δ`, the interpretation `I(Γ ⊢ Δ) = 1` (meaning the sequent is true) if:
  - **Either** `I(X) = 0` for some formula `X` in `Γ` (one of the premises is false),
  - **Or** `I(Y) = 1` for some formula `Y` in `Δ` (one of the conclusions is true).

#### Intuitive Explanation

What this definition says is that a sequent `Γ ⊢ Δ` is true if:

- At least one of the formulas in the hypothesis set `Γ` is false,
- Or, at least one formula in the conclusion set `Δ` is true.

This corresponds to an **intuitive idea** in logic that if any **premise** is false, the argument can hold, or if any **conclusion** is true, the argument is valid.

---

#### Example of Sequent Interpretation

The text offers an example interpretation:

- The sequent `Δ ⊢ Γ` can be seen as representing the logical formula:
  - $(A1 \land A2 \land ... \land An) \Rightarrow (B1 \lor B2 \lor ... \lor Bk)$
  
In other words, `Γ` (the premises) implies `Δ` (the conclusions).
