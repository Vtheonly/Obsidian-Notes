You're correct that both "pull" and "clone" are Git commands used to obtain code from a remote repository, typically hosted on platforms like GitHub. However, they serve different purposes:

1. **Clone:**
   - When you use the "git clone" command, you are essentially creating a copy of the entire remote repository on your local machine. This includes all of the repository's files, commit history, branches, and other information.
   - Cloning is typically used when you want to start working on a project from scratch or if you want a complete local copy of a repository.
   - The initial clone downloads everything, but after that, you can use "git pull" to keep your local copy up to date by fetching and merging changes from the remote repository.

   Example:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. **Pull:**
   - The "git pull" command is used to fetch and incorporate changes from a remote repository into your existing local repository. It's a way to update your local copy with the latest changes made by others in the remote repository.
   - Pulling only brings the changes (new commits and associated files) made since your last update. It does not download the entire repository again.

   Example:
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

In summary, "clone" is used to create a fresh copy of a remote repository on your local machine, while "pull" is used to update your existing local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository. "Pull" is more focused on bringing in the incremental updates, not the entire repository.
