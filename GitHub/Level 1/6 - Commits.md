You have described the process of reviewing changes in a Git repository very accurately. Let me clarify and expand on your points:

1. **Viewing Changes:** To see the changes you've made in a Git repository, you can use the "git log" command to display a list of commits. Each commit has a unique identifier, known as a "commit hash" or "SHA-1 hash." This identifier is a long hexadecimal string (e.g., `a1b2c3d`) that uniquely identifies the commit.

2. **Commit Messages:** Each commit is associated with a commit message, which is a description of the changes made in that commit. Commit messages are typically concise but informative, explaining what the change is about and why it was made. This helps collaborators and future maintainers understand the purpose of each change.

3. **Viewing Commit Details:** When you want to see what was added or modified in a particular commit, you can use the "git show" command followed by the commit hash. This command displays the changes introduced in that specific commit.

4. **Visualizing Changes:** Some Git platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, provide a user-friendly web interface for visualizing changes in commits. When you click on a commit, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the changes made in that commit. New code lines are typically highlighted in green, deleted lines in red, and unchanged lines in white or gray.

5. **Branches and History:** Commits are organized into branches, which represent different lines of development. You can switch between branches to view their commit history and changes. Commits in a branch are typically based on a common ancestor, and you can see how the code evolves over time.

This version control system allows developers to keep track of code changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a clear history of the project's development. Commit messages and the ability to review changes are crucial for understanding the codebase and making informed decisions during development and maintenance.
