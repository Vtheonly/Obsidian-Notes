# Configuration Files for Application Menu Entries in Linux Systems

## Clarifying the Context
In Linux systems, application menu entries and launchers are defined by `.desktop` files. These files instruct desktop environments (such as GNOME, KDE) on how to display and launch applications, including their names, icons, and commands. Managing these `.desktop` files allows users to customize their system's application behavior, adjust the user interface, and even hide unwanted apps from the application menu.

## Common Locations of `.desktop` Files
Depending on the installation type and scope (system-wide or user-specific), `.desktop` files can be found in various directories.

### 1. User-Specific Application Menu Entries
- **Location**: `~/.local/share/applications/`
- Stores `.desktop` files for applications installed by the user or customized launchers. This location is user-specific and does not affect other users on the system.

### 2. System-Wide Application Menu Entries
- **Location**: `/usr/share/applications/`
- This directory holds `.desktop` files for applications installed system-wide, accessible to all users on the system.

### 3. Snap and Flatpak Application Menu Entries
#### Snap Applications
- **Location**: `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/`
- Applications installed through Snap place their `.desktop` files here, affecting how they appear in the menu system.

#### Flatpak Applications
- **Locations**:
  - **System-wide**: `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/`
  - **User-specific**: `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/`
  These locations are specific to Flatpak applications, distinguishing system-wide from user-specific entries.

### 4. Wine Applications
- **Location**: `/home/mersel/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/`
- Applications installed through Wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications) place their `.desktop` files in this directory. Wine uses this folder to create launchers for Windows applications, making them accessible from the Linux desktop environment.

## Modifying `.desktop` Files

Customizing `.desktop` files can change how applications are displayed in the menu or even hide them entirely. Common modifications include altering the application's name, icon, or the command that launches it.

### Common Fields in `.desktop` Files
- **Name**: The display name of the application in the app menu.
- **Icon**: Path to the icon file associated with the application.
- **Exec**: The command to run when the application is launched.
- **NoDisplay**: Set this to `true` to hide the application from the app menu without uninstalling it.

### Editing Steps:
1. **Locate the `.desktop` File**: Identify the correct file by navigating to one of the directories mentioned above.
2. **Open with a Text Editor**: Use editors like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit` to open the `.desktop` file.
3. **Modify the Fields**: Make changes to fields like `Name`, `Icon`, `Exec`, or add `NoDisplay=true` to hide the app from the menu.
4. **Save and Refresh**: After saving the changes, refresh the desktop environment or restart the system for the modifications to take effect.

### Example `.desktop` File
```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Name=ExampleApp
Exec=/path/to/executable
Icon=/path/to/icon
Type=Application
NoDisplay=true
```

- `Name=ExampleApp`: This defines how the application will be named in the app menu.
- `Exec=/path/to/executable`: This points to the command that launches the application.
- `Icon=/path/to/icon`: The location of the icon file to display.
- `NoDisplay=true`: This will hide the app from the menu but keep it installed and usable.

## Hiding Applications from the "Show Applications" Menu

### Use Case: Hiding Unwanted Apps
Sometimes you may want to hide an application from the app menu without uninstalling it (e.g., if it's part of a package with dependencies). You can achieve this by modifying the corresponding `.desktop` file and adding the `NoDisplay=true` directive.

#### Example Steps:
1. **Locate the `.desktop` File**: For example, Wine applications may have their `.desktop` files under `/home/mersel/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/`.
2. **Edit the File**: Open the `.desktop` file of the unwanted application (e.g., `MyWindowsApp.desktop`).
3. **Add the Hiding Command**:
   ```bash
   NoDisplay=true
   ```
4. **Save the File** and refresh the desktop environment.

This method hides the application from the "Show Applications" menu but retains its functionality for use through the command line or other methods.

## Further Customization
To create custom launchers or advanced application configurations, you can reference the structure and fields of existing `.desktop` files. Modifying or creating new `.desktop` entries gives you full control over how applications behave and appear in your Linux desktop environment.
