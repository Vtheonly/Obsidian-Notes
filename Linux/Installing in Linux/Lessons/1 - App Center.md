# Installing in Linux

## When You Download from the App Center, Where Are the Apps Located?
When you download applications from the **App Center** (or Software Center) in Linux, they are typically installed in standard directories depending on the type of application:

- **System-wide applications**: These are usually installed in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or similar directories. 
- **User-specific applications**: Some apps might be installed in directories like `~/.local/share/applications` or `~/.local/bin`, which are specific to the user and do not require administrative rights.

You can access these applications from your application menu or launcher.

## Difference Between Downloading an App from the App Center and Downloading It as Open Source
- **App Center Downloads**: When you download an application from the App Center, you typically receive a pre-packaged version that has been curated for your Linux distribution. These packages are often tested for compatibility and security, ensuring they work seamlessly with your system.
  
- **Open Source Downloads**: Downloading open-source software usually involves obtaining the source code or a specific package (like a .deb or .tar.gz file) from the developer's repository or website. You may need to compile the application yourself or ensure itâ€™s compatible with your distribution, which may require additional steps and dependencies. Open-source software provides more flexibility and customization options but may come with less user-friendly installation processes.

## How to Make Them the Same, So That They Are Located in the Same Directory and Treated by the System as the Same?

To ensure that applications from different sources are treated the same way and are located in the same directory, follow these steps:

1. **Use Standard Installation Methods**: Always try to install applications using the standard package manager (APT, Snap, Flatpak) for your distribution. This helps in maintaining a uniform directory structure and ensures that the applications are correctly recognized by the system.

2. **Create Symbolic Links**: If you have an application installed in a non-standard location (like an AppImage), you can create a symbolic link in a standard directory:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /path/to/your/appimage /usr/local/bin/appname
   ```
   This way, you can run the application from the command line without navigating to its specific location.

3. **Use Environment Variables**: If you have specific applications in custom directories, you can add those directories to your PATH environment variable. This makes it easier for the system to recognize them:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory
   ```

4. **Package Custom Apps**: For advanced users, you can package your custom applications in a format compatible with your package manager (like creating a .deb or snap package). This allows you to install them using the same methods as standard applications, ensuring they are located in standard directories.

By following these practices, you can streamline your applications and ensure they are treated consistently by your Linux system.
